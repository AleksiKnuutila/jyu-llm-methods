## Text classification and annotation with large language models 

A methods course at the University of Jyväskylä.

**Description**

Large language models (LLMs) are widely known for enabling products such as ChatGPT and Bard. This section explores their use in the social sciences and humanities as tools for analyzing text corpora. In the section, we describe firstly a supervised classification of documents, in which an LLM is used to replicate categorisations made by a researcher on a larger textual dataset. We also describe how to use LLMs to extract information from documents without a predefined taxonomy through an example of identifying agents in texts. The first session is a lecture, and the second is a practical demo, in which students may use provided example datasets or bring their own. Some experience in programming with Python is an advantage if you would like to apply the tools described in this section, but it is not strictly necessary to participate. Passing the section requires attending the lecture and participating in the practical demo.

**Preparations**

1. Consider if there is a dataset you would like to annotate as an experiment. Ideally the datasets would contain text documents of about 100-1,000 characters. The dataset could be related to your own personal work or some publicly available dataset that you are interested in.
2. Make sure you can log into CSC Notebooks at https://notebooks.rahtiapp.fi/welcome
