Izvestia correspondents visited the underground ""Caches"", saw weapons reserves and found out whether their Russian troops could use their troops.

The fighters found Ukrainian weapons at a depth of more than 150 m in the former salt mines of Artemovsk. One of these objects was built during the time of the USSR with the expectation that the degree of protection will allow even the use of nuclear weapons.

In warehouses - thousands of weapons under the cartridge 7.62*54 mm, which remains the main rifle and in the modern Russian army. Therefore, many types of weapons remain relevant in modern conditions. First of all, we are talking about machine guns. In addition, two American Barrett M-107 sniper rifles were discovered 12.7 mm caliber in army design with silent shooting devices.

In long-term storage warehouses, a huge number of submachine guns of the times of the Great Patriotic War. These are the famous Soviet PPSh and PPS, most of which are completely new.

Mine trunks: what is stored at the Secret Objects of the VFU in Artemovsk","На освобожденной территории в районе Артемовска (украинское название — Бахмут) российские бойцы проводят «инвентаризацию» украинских военных объектов. Корреспонденты «Известий» побывали в подземном «схроне», увидели запасы оружия и узнали, смогут ли использовать их российские войска.

Бойцы находили украинские склады оружия на глубине более 150 м в бывших соляных шахтах Артемовска. Один из таких объектов построили еще во времена СССР с расчетом на то, что степень их защиты позволит выдержать даже применение ядерного оружия.

На складах — тысячи единиц оружия под патрон 7,62*54 мм, который остается основным винтовочным и в современной российской армии. Поэтому многие виды вооружения остаются актуальными в современных условиях. В первую очередь речь о пулеметах. Кроме того, обнаружены две американские снайперские винтовки «Баррет М-107» калибра 12,7 мм в армейском исполнении с приборами бесшумной стрельбы.

На складах длительного хранения огромное количество пистолетов-пулеметов времен еще Великой Отечественной войны. Это знаменитые советские ППШ и ППС, большая часть которых — абсолютно новые.

Then, the deputy head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Anna Malelya admitted that the situation on the entire front line remains difficult, especially in the Artyomovsky direction, where the Russian army ""uses the tactics of exhaustion and total destruction.""

Prior to this, on February 24, the Ukrainian leader called the situation in the eastern direction of military operations very complex and painful. At the same time, the state of affairs south, according to him, is very dangerous.

Ранее в этот день врио главы Донецкой Народной Республики (ДНР) Денис Пушилин сообщил, что российские силы контролируют почти все дороги в город Артемовск. По его словам, войсками РФ был нарушен и прекращен подвоз боеприпасов гарнизону ВСУ, остановлены ротация и пополнение живой силы противника.

Кроме того, в понедельник Пушилин сообщил, что за последнее время произошли существенные изменения на артемовском направлении.

Тогда же заместитель главы минобороны Украины Анна Маляр признала, что ситуация на всей линии фронта остается сложной, особенно на артемовском направлении, где армия РФ «использует тактику истощения и тотального разрушения».

When I went outside, we walked at night, I looked like a single house, it's just horror! For three days there was not a single house, they didn’t leave a stone on the stone, ”the woman told RIA Novosti correspondent.

Irina also noted that, according to the Wagner group, who had taken refugees, Ukrainian militants shot the residents from the tank in the houses, and the basements with hiding civilians were thrown with grenades.

Об этом в четверг, 23 марта, рассказала эвакуированная российскими войсками жительница города Ирина Турова.

По ее словам, массированные бомбардировки района проводились 25 и 26 февраля.

«Я не помню, это было или утром, или после обеда — начали летать мины, и кидали их со стороны «Цветмета» (Артемовский завод по обработке цветных металлов. — Ред.), они ложились по нашей улице. Когда я вышла на улицу, мы шли ночью, я как глянула — ни одного дома нет, это просто ужас! За три дня ни одного дома нету, камня на камне не оставили», — рассказала женщина корреспонденту «РИА Новости».

Также Ирина отметила, что, по словам выводившего беженцев сотрудника группы «Вагнер», украинские боевики расстреливали оставшихся в домах жителей из танка, а подвалы с прячущимися мирными гражданами закидывали гранатами.

Женщина смогла насчитать порядка 130 мин, разорвавшихся рядом с подвалом, где она пряталась от обстрелов.

«И что самое обидное, как говорят, свои по своим бьют! Но какие же они теперь свои?! Это же уроды просто», — резюмировала жительница Артемовска.

Thus, he reacted to the proposal of the supreme representative on foreign policy and security of the EU Josep Boar at an informal meeting with the ministers of the EU countries to establish joint purchases of weapons for Ukraine.

“They are trying to force European states to convey those ammunition that they do not want to transmit, for example, due to the calculation of their safety. Or they simply do not want to participate in this conflict, for example, like Hungary. The European Union presses, creates the rules by which “you can’t get anywhere, your reserves will be evaluated by officials from Brussels, and you will be forced to transfer them to Kiev,” the MP Duma TV for Izvestia quotes you.

On March 6, the El Pais newspaper wrote that the European Commission will allocate € 1 billion for the joint purchase of weapons and ammunition for Kyiv as part of an emergency support package.

The publication says that the EU members urge the EU members to send ammunition “from their arsenals” to Ukraine, especially the long -range artillery settings of 155 mm caliber. This is due to the difficult situation of the Ukrainian military near Artyomovsky (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut) and complaints of the Kyiv regime about the lack of shells and weapons.

On March 3, Ukraine turned to the EU with a call to allocate 250 thousand artillery shells every month as part of military assistance to Kyiv. The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine sent a letter to European colleagues, in which he said that the country's armed forces are very limited in their capabilities due to a shortage of ammunition.

The Western countries strengthened the military and financial support of Kyiv against the background of a special operation of the Russian Federation on the protection of Donbass, the decision of which was made against the backdrop of exacerbation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.","Евросоюз (ЕС) хочет надавить на европейские страны, которые не желают передавать Украине вооружение.

«Они пытаются заставить европейские государства передать те боеприпасы, которые они не хотят передавать, например, в силу расчета своей безопасности. Или просто не хотят участвовать в этом конфликте, например, как Венгрия. Евросоюз давит, создает правила, по которым «ты никуда не денешься, твои запасы будут оценены чиновниками из Брюсселя, и тебя заставят передать их Киеву», — приводит слова депутата «Дума ТВ» для «Известий».

6 марта газета El Pais написала, что Еврокомиссия выделит €1 млрд на совместную закупку оружия и боеприпасов для Киева в рамках чрезвычайного пакета поддержки.

В публикации говорится, что государства — члены ЕС призывают направить на Украину боеприпасы «из своих арсеналов», особенно дальнобойные артиллерийские установки калибра 155 мм. Это связано с тяжелым положением украинских военных под Артемовском (украинское название — Бахмут) и жалобами киевского режима на недостаток снарядов и вооружений.

3 марта Украина обратилась к ЕС с призывом каждый месяц выделять 250 тыс. артиллерийских снарядов в рамках военной помощи Киеву. Глава минобороны Украины отправил письмо европейским коллегам, в котором сообщил, что Вооруженные силы страны сильно ограничены в своих возможностях из-за дефицита боеприпасов.

The defense department told about the shooter of the motorized rifle unit of the corporal Danil Ivlev, who storms the strongholds of nationalists during the promotion of the Russian troops deep into the enemy’s defense. The detachment was set to storm the fortified militants. As specified in the Ministry of Defense, the enemy equipped a fortified area in a forest belt with a deeply echeloned defense system of mine-explosive barriers, as well as long-term firing points. At the same time, the defense was held by the selected units of Ukrainian nationalists, reinforced by armored vehicles and artillery.

After intelligence, the detachment quietly got to the positions of defending militants and neutralized minefields. Danil Ivlev personally destroyed two enemy observers. Then the Russian military committed a secretive maneuver in the flank of the defending units of Ukrainian nationalists. Having promptly evaluating the situation and conducting the reconnaissance, the corporal transferred the coordinates of the enemy’s defeat of the enemy to the artillery unit.

Two long -term firing points were suppressed by the blow of Russian artillery. The suddenness of the actions of the assault detachment disorganized the defense of the militants. Continuing assault actions, the Russian detachment entered the line of attacks and knocked out units of militants from prepared firing positions. As a result, the fortified is completely under the control of Russian forces.

In addition, the department noted the courage of the guards of Private Artem Sharikov, who defended the settlement, who was released from Ukrainian militants. During the battle, the balls with the help of a drone revealed five infantry combat vehicles (BMP) and three tanks, as well as up to 20 nationalists trying to get around the village from the flank, after which he transferred the coordinates to a higher headquarters. Based on the data provided by the guards by the ordinary, a fire defeat was inflicted on the attacking forces of the enemy. Having suffered losses, the enemy waited for reinforcement and made another attempt to return the lost positions under his control.

During the defense, the commander of the department was wounded. Sharikov accepted the command of the department. Managing the fire of his department, he constrained the enemy’s actions and reflected the offensive of the nationalists in his direction.

The day before, it became known that Russian paratroopers over the past week reached the power line, which divides the Kremena forest into two equal parts. With the support of army air strikes, artillery fire, parachute-long regiments and formations, TOS-1A Suncocks, tanks and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Russian fighters captured 17 strongholds of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Armed Forces).

In addition, on April 10, the acting head of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) Denis Pushilin said that more than 75% of the territory of Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut) is currently under the control of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, he noted that fierce battles are still underway in the western part of the city.

В оборонном ведомстве рассказали про стрелка мотострелкового подразделения ефрейтора Данила Ивлева, который штурмует опорные пункты националистов в ходе продвижения российских войск вглубь обороны противника. Отряду была поставлена задача по штурму укрепрайона боевиков. Как уточнили в Минобороны, противник оборудовал укрепленный район в лесополосе с глубоко эшелонированной системой обороны минно-взрывными заграждениями, а также долговременными огневыми точками. Оборону при этом удерживали отборные подразделения украинских националистов, усиленные бронетехникой и артиллерийскими средствами.

После проведенной разведки отряд незаметно подобрался к позициям обороняющихся боевиков и обезвредил минные заграждения. Данил Ивлев лично уничтожил двоих вражеских наблюдателей. Затем российские военнослужащие совершили скрытный маневр во фланг обороняющихся подразделений украинских националистов. Оперативно оценив обстановку и проведя доразведку, ефрейтор передал координаты средств поражения противника артиллерийскому подразделению.

Ударом российской артиллерии были подавлены две долговременные огневые точки. Внезапность действий штурмового отряда дезорганизовала оборону боевиков. Продолжив штурмовые действия, российский отряд вышел на рубеж атаки и выбил подразделения боевиков с подготовленных огневых позиций. В результате укрепрайон полностью перешел под контроль российских сил.

Сырский также отметил, что в настоящий момент командование украинской группировки принимает меры, нацеленные на «восстановление боеспособности частей и срыва вражеских намерений».

Он рассказал, что служил в 93-й отдельной механизированной бригаде войск Украины, в разведроте, и попал в плен 26 марта в Артемовске.

«Произошел штурм девятиэтажки, в которой мы находились. Так как у нас заканчивались уже боеприпасы, запросили поддержки, поддержки не получили, и под напором ЧВК «Вагнер» приняли решение сдаться, так как уже не могли вести бой», — приводит его слова агентство «РИА Новости».

Кривозуб отметил, что в плену с ним обращаются хорошо, кормят, дают воду. Кроме того, ему была оказана медицинская помощь в связи с ранением предплечья.

In addition, he added Prigozhin, the situation in Artemovsk is a destabilizing factor for Kyiv despite the fact that control over the city does not give special advantages.

In general, he noted the symbolic significance of the city. This, according to him, is fair for the Russian forces, for which the work does not end in Artemovsk, but is just beginning, because it is followed by Seversk, Slavyansk, Kramatorsk, Konstantinovka, Druzhkovka and the clock.

Earlier on this day, an employee of the Wagner PMC said that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation squeezed out Ukrainian units from Artemovsk, clamping them in ticks. He also called on the Ukrainian Armed Forces to escape until the ring around the city closed.

Then, the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, said that the assault detachments of the Wagner PMC are conducting the fighting of high intensity to master the quarters of the western part of Artemovsk.

The assault groups advanced gradually, directly entering the contact battle with Ukrainian militants, in order to also protect the civilian population, which was located in these areas.

По словам корреспондента, некоторые районы города уже не только освобождены, но и полностью зачищены российскими силами. На домах видны следы боев, часть из них, где были выявлены огневые точки противников, уничтожена артиллерией.

Штурмовые группы продвигались постепенно, непосредственно вступая в контактный бой с украинскими боевиками, чтобы в том числе обезопасить мирное население, которое находилось в этих районах.

«Окопы идут прямиком в дома. Прямиком в жилые дома, то есть противник осуществлял ротацию, подброс БК (боекомплектов. — Ред.), эвакуацию раненых абсолютно скрытно. Видите, позиции серьезные, и сами понимаете, какие здесь были бои, чтобы их из этих позиций выколупать», — рассказал корреспонденту российский военный.

“But from the Ukrainian side there is no progress in resolving the issue in this way. And even if they will take an attempt to release them, whether it will be successful - the question is open. Therefore, I think, sooner or later, those who sit in the city will pass their nerves. They say that they are already handing over. They are just in a hopeless position and understand this well, ”the expert said.

Ukrainian forces are trying to withdraw troops out of the city, but the exit along the forest paths for these fighters will end poorly, the expert believes.

“All asphalt roads are destroyed. And if you do not have equipment, you will not go far from them - the intelligence will notice, determine the thermal imager, and the artillery will definitely cover them. Therefore, they do not dare to go along these roads. If the Ukrainian army needs such fighters, they must do everything to save their lives and withdraw them from the city. But, I think they don’t need them, they needed a settlement to constrain our forces and means, ”he said.

In the western quarters of Artemovsk, Russian assault detachments continued active actions to destroy the enemy. Units of the airborne troops constrained Ukrainian formations on the flanks. The blows of operational-tactical and army aviation, artillery and heavy flamethrower systems of the southern group of troops are amazed at the enemy units in the regions of the settlements of Grigorovka and Bogdanovka in the DPR, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported on May 3.

Quarterly account: troops storm the western outskirts of Artemovsk","Для вывода своих войск из Артемовска (украинское название — Бахмут) ВФУ нужно проводить операцию по деблокированию — с Константиновки или Часова Яра предпринять мощное наступление, чтобы пробить коридор и вывести из города тех, кто еще остался, рассказал «Известиям» военный эксперт Алексей Леонков.

«Но с украинской стороны не видно подвижек в решении вопроса таким образом. И даже если попытку деблокировать они предпримут, будет ли она удачной — вопрос открытый. Поэтому, думаю, рано или поздно у тех, кто сидит в городе, нервы сдадут. Говорят, что уже сдают. Просто они находятся в безвыходном положении и хорошо понимают это», — отметил эксперт.

Украинские силы стараются вывести войска из города, но выход по лесным тропам для этих бойцов плохо закончится, считает эксперт.

«Все асфальтовые дороги разрушены. И если у вас нет техники, вы по ним далеко не уйдете — разведка заметит, в тепловизор определит, и артиллерия их точно накроет. Поэтому они не решаются выходить по этим дорогам. Если украинской армии нужны такие бойцы, они должны сделать всё, чтобы сохранить их жизнь и вывести их из города. Но, думаю, они им не нужны, им был нужен населенный пункт, чтобы сковывать наши силы и средства», — сказал он.

В западных кварталах Артемовска российские штурмовые отряды продолжали активные действия по уничтожению противника. Подразделения воздушно-десантных войск сковывали украинские формирования на флангах.

При этом, по его словам, киевские власти продолжают перебрасывать свои резервы на артемовское направление.

По мнению врио главы ДНР, украинские боевики намеренно атакуют гражданские объекты республики. Пушилин подчеркнул, что у местных властей есть как минимум два случая, в которых была точно доказана целенаправленность обстрелов гражданской инфраструктуры.

Ранее в этот день в представительстве ДНР в Совместном центре контроля и координации вопросов, связанных с военными преступлениями Украины, сообщили, что ВСУ за три часа выпустили более 40 снарядов по Донецку. Из них 37 были боеприпасами натовского калибра 155 мм.

This was announced on February 26 by Izvestia by the head of the Department of Political Science and Sociology of the REU named after G.V. Plekhanova, expert of the Association of Military Political Sciences Andrei Koshkin.

According to him, the Armed Forces ""are fighting against all in order to triumph their ideology of Bandera.""

On the eve of an adviser to the acting head of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Jan Gagin told Izvestia that Ukrainian militants blew up a dam in Artemovsk. Water flooded at home and basements in which people hid.

As the adviser to the acting head of the DPR Igor Kimakovsky emphasized, this was done to slow down the advance of the Russian military. He added that the separation of the dam may talk about the intention of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to leave Artemovsk, and the actions of the Kyiv regime can be described as desperate.

The Investigative Committee of Russia will investigate the circumstances of the pressure of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces in Artemovsk.

Об этом 28 февраля сообщил подполковник Народной милиции Луганской Народной Республики (ЛНР) в отставке Андрей Марочко.

«Выявлено прибытие около 30 единиц легкобронированной колесной и гусеничной техники, порядка 350 обученных военнослужащих рядового состава и до 15 офицеров, скорее всего прошедших обучение на полигонах НАТО», — цитирует Марочко «РИА Новости».

Как отметил военный эксперт, согласно имеющейся у него информации, прибывший личный состав противника отличается высокой дисциплиной и мотивацией, добавляет «Газета.Ru».

21 февраля Марочко сообщал, что ВСУ пытаются разблокировать частично перекрытые пути снабжения Артемовска в Донбассе. По его словам, в этих целях в направлении населенного пункта Часов Яр Киевом переброшен батальон националистов. Подполковник уточнил, что перед националистами стоят задачи удержать позиции ВСУ, а также помешать украинским военным из числа мобилизованных бежать с поля боя.

Днем ранее, 20 февраля, Марочко сообщил, что ВСУ ведут активную подготовку к обороне города Часов Яр. Там отмечается увеличение фортификационных сооружений и контингента украинских войск.

19 февраля президент Украины Владимир Зеленский заявил, что ВСУ не будут сражаться за Артемовск любой ценой и до последнего боевика, так как это не очень большой город.

Россия 24 февраля 2022 года начала проведение специальной операции по защите Донбасса. Решение было принято на фоне обострения ситуации в регионе в результате обстрелов со стороны украинских военных.

On Monday, March 6, said the adviser to the head of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Yang Gagin on the air of the Russia 1 television channel.

“Now in Artemovsk there is a fairly large garrison - this is about 10 thousand people, perhaps more. Some parts left him, some parts are trying to leave him. At the same time, our artillery tries to get them, ”he said.

The representative of the DPR noted that Russian forces control all entrances to the city, so the delivery of ammunition and the transportation of the military is “problematic and dangerous” for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Armed Forces).



Gagin did not exclude the possibility of attempts by the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces to Artemovsk in order to deliver something, for example, ammunition.

“And in the same way there will be attempts to break through from there, including the battle, to get in the same watch,” Gagin predicts.

Earlier on Monday, March 6, the observers of The New York Times wrote that the Kyiv authorities began to prepare Ukrainians for the surrender of Artemovsk. The interlocutors of the publication, in turn, pointed out the cut of the city from the vital ways of supply, as well as the gradual environment of Artemovsk by Russian forces.

Later on this day, in an interview with Izvestia, political scientist Yuri Svetov said that the differences between the political and military leaders of Ukraine about Artemovsk are reflected in the soldiers of the Armed Forces.

We are talking about the conflict between the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky and the Commander -in -Chief of the Ukrainian troops Valery Zaluzhny. So, the helmet several weeks ago recommended thinking about the retreat from Artemovsk, while Zelensky did not agree with him. On March 4, the Ukrainian military analyst Peter Chernik admitted that soon the Ukrainian military will leave Artemovsk.

On March 3, the commander of the Ukrainian troops with the call sign, Magyar, said that the APU unit received an order from the command to immediately leave Artemovsk. However, military expert Vasily Dandykin pointed out that the Ukrainian military is not the most reliable source and in the current conditions, misinformation is possible.

A special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an exacerbation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

Об этом в понедельник, 6 марта, заявил советник главы Донецкой Народной республики Ян Гагин в эфире телеканала «Россия 1».

«Сейчас в Артемовске остается достаточно большой гарнизон — это около 10 тыс. человек, возможно, больше. Некоторые части покинули его, некоторые части пытаются покидать его. При этом наша артиллерия старается их достать», — сказал он.

Представитель ДНР отметил, что российские силы контролируют все подъезды к городу, поэтому доставка боеприпасов и перевозка военных «проблематична и опасна» для Вооруженных сил Украины (ВСУ).



Гагин не исключил возможности попыток ВСУ прорыва в Артемовск, чтобы что-то доставить, например, боекомплект.

«И точно так же будут попытки прорваться оттуда, в том числе с боем, чтобы попасть в тот же Часов Яр», — прогнозирует Гагин.

Ранее в понедельник, 6 марта, обозреватели газеты The New York Times написали, что киевские власти начали готовить украинцев к сдаче Артемовска. Собеседники издания, в свою очередь, указали на отрезанность города от жизненно важных путей снабжения, а также на постепенное окружение Артемовска российскими силами.

Позже в этот день в беседе с «Известиями» политолог Юрий Светов заявил, что разногласия между политическим и военным руководствами Украины по поводу Артемовска отражаются на солдатах ВСУ.

Речь идет о конфликте между президентом Украины Владимиром Зеленским и главнокомандующим украинскими войсками Валерием Залужным. Так, Залужный еще несколько недель назад рекомендовал подумать об отступлении из Артемовска, в то время как Зеленский с ним не согласился. 4 марта украинский военный аналитик Петр Черник признал, что в скором времени украинские военные оставят Артемовск.

3 марта командир украинских войск с позывным Мадьяр заявил, что подразделение ВСУ получило приказ от командования немедленно покинуть Артемовск. Однако военный эксперт Василий Дандыкин указал, что украинские военные — не самый надежный источник и в текущих условиях возможна дезинформация.

On Friday, May 26, he wrote in his Twitter account.

The journalist commented on the statement of the coordinator of strategic communications in the US National Security Council John Kirby that Artemovsk is not of strategic importance.



“If each region of Ukraine <...>“ practically does not have strategic value, ”why do we send Ukraine hundreds of billions of dollars to conquer these territories?” - said Hinkle.

Earlier, on May 24, the ex-analytician of the CIA in Russia George Bib criticized the tactics of the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in Artemovsk. In his opinion, the troops had to be withdrawn from the city as early as possible, since the tightening of combat forces there still did not lead Kyiv to victory.



On May 20, it became known about the full capture of Artemovsk by Russian forces. The operation to capture the city lasted 224 days.

After that, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Russian fighters on the successful completion of the operation. The Kremlin noted that all the distinguished ones will be represented by the State Bedes.

The special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Putin announced on February 24 last year, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an exacerbation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

Об этом в пятницу, 26 мая, он написал в своем аккаунте в Twitter.

Журналист прокомментировал заявление координатора стратегических коммуникаций в Совете национальной безопасности США Джона Кирби о том, что Артемовск не имеет стратегического значения.



«Если каждый регион Украины <...> «практически не имеет стратегической ценности», зачем мы посылаем Украине сотни миллиардов долларов на отвоевание этих территорий?» — сообщил Хинкл.

Ранее, 24 мая, экс-аналитик ЦРУ по России Джордж Биб раскритиковал тактику президента Украины Владимира Зеленского в Артемовске. По его мнению, войска надо было вывести из города как можно раньше, так как стягивание туда боевых сил всё равно не привело Киев к победе.



20 мая стало известно о полном взятии Артемовска российскими силами. Операция по взятию города длилась 224 дня.

После этого президент России Владимир Путин поздравил российских бойцов с успешным завершением операции. В Кремле отметили, что все отличившиеся будут представлены к госнаградам.

Об этом в среду, 26 апреля, сообщил официальный представитель Минобороны РФ генерал-лейтенант Игорь Конашенков.

«На донецком направлении штурмовые отряды продолжали уничтожение подразделений ВСУ (Вооруженные силы Украины. — Ред.) и наемников в западной части города Артемовск. Подразделения воздушно-десантных войск и Южной группировки войск оказывали поддержку действиям штурмовых отрядов и пресекали попытки подразделений ВСУ контратаковать на северном и южном флангах», — сказал он.

Кроме того, на южнодонецком направлении в районах Сладкого и Шевченко Донецкой Народной Республики (ДНР) уничтожены две украинские диверсионно-разведывательные группы (ДРГ).

В оборонном ведомстве добавили, что на южнодонецком и запорожском направлениях ликвидировано за сутки порядка 25 украинских солдат. Помимо этого, в указанных районах уничтожены боевая бронированная машина, два автомобиля, а также гаубица Д-30.

Накануне, 25 апреля, Конашенков рассказал, что Воздушно-десантные войска (ВДВ) и авиация Вооруженных сил (ВС) РФ пресекли попытки ВСУ перебросить свои резервы в Артемовск. Он отметил, что штурмовые отряды продолжили активное уничтожение противника на западе города.

В тот же день корреспондент «Известий» Алексей Полторанин сообщил, что российские силы контролируют большую часть города: военным удалось занять частный сектор, элеватор, станцию Бахмут-2, а также перерезать пути снабжения противника по дороге от города Часов Яр.

В тот же день сотрудник ЧВК «Вагнер» рассказал, что в Артемовске фиксировались попытки украинских боевиков выйти из города под видом мирных жителей во время эвакуации, проводимой российским силами.

Специальная операция по защите Донбасса, о начале которой президент России Владимир Путин объявил 24 февраля 2022 года, продолжается. Решение было принято на фоне обострения ситуации в регионе из-за обстрелов со стороны украинских военных.

Thus, he reacted to the opinion of the analyst Barry Hanton in the material for The Associated Press that the West can stop supporting Kiev if the Armed Forces of Ukraine (APU) will not demonstrate success with the armed forces on the battlefield.

“This is a reminder to Zelensky that he continues to fulfill the obligations taken to the United States and the European Union to act in the future as an aggressor towards the Russian Federation and be more decisive in terms of extermination of his own people. In recent months - defeat behind the defeat by Ukraine, the population of the population is visible. It is precisely the aggression and determination that the United States is now needed by the leadership of Ukraine, ”the Smooth“ Duma TV ”for Izvestia quotes.

On March 29, Zelensky stated that if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated in Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut), then the international community and residents of the country will begin to actually push official Kyiv to a compromise with the Russian Federation.

Commenting on the words of Zelensky, the State Duma deputy Valery Seleznev suggested that the Ukrainian leader understands that, without showing the West, the results on the battlefield may lose his position.

On the same day, it became known that every third American stated that the United States is overly supporting Ukraine. This is evidenced by the results of the survey conducted by the University of the University of Quinnipiac University Poll.

Western countries strengthened the military and financial support of Ukraine against the backdrop of the Russian special operation to protect Donbass, about which the Russian authorities announced on February 24, 2022 amid the aggravation of the situation in the region due to Ukrainian shelling.","США и Евросоюз требуют от президента Украины Владимира Зеленского решительности и агрессии в сторону России. Об этом 3 апреля заявил депутат Госдумы Борис Гладких.

Таким образом он отреагировал на мнение аналитика Барри Хэнтона в материале для The Associated Press о том, что Запад может прекратить поддерживать Киев, если Вооруженные силы Украины (ВСУ) не продемонстрируют успеха с поставленными вооружениями на поле боя.

«Это напоминание Зеленскому о том, чтобы он продолжил выполнять обязательства, взятые перед США и Евросоюзом, выступать в дальнейшем агрессором в сторону РФ и быть более решительным в части истребления собственного народа. За последние месяцы — поражение за поражением со стороны Украины, виден страх у населения. Вот именно агрессия и решительность сейчас нужны США со стороны руководства Украины», — приводит слова Гладких «Дума ТВ» для «Известий».

29 марта Зеленский заявил, что если ВСУ потерпят поражение в Артемовске (украинское название — Бахмут), то международное сообщество и жители страны начнут активнее подталкивать официальный Киев к компромиссу с РФ.

Комментируя слова Зеленского, депутат Госдумы Валерий Селезнев предположил, что украинский лидер понимает, что, не показав Западу результатов на поле боя, может лишиться своей должности.

В тот же день стало известно, что каждый третий американец заявил, что США чрезмерно поддерживают Украину. Об этом свидетельствуют результаты опроса, проведенного исследовательской службой Университета Куиннипэк (Quinnipiac University Poll).

40,iz.ru,Politico: США ожидают начала наступления ВСУ на восток или юг к маю,"According to the American side, Ukraine will begin on May. The newspaper Politico writes about this on March 16.

“American officials are focused on the preparation of Ukraine for a large -scale spring offensive, which, as they expect, will begin by May,” the statement said.

According to an unnamed US official, assistance packages that the United States transferred four to five months ago are necessary for the counterattack of Ukrainian fighters, RT reports.

The material notes that hundreds of western tanks and armored vehicles are sent to Ukraine. The United States and European partners also supply huge amounts of ammunition and 155 mm shells, NSN reports.

He also added that while Kyiv does not have a strategy about the offensive, but there are two options. The first is to promote south to Crimea through Kherson. The second is to move east from its positions in the north, and then south to cut off the land bridge of the Russian Federation, according to the website of Kp.ru.

American officials believe that the first scenario is not very realistic due to the fact that Russian troops strengthened the defense on the eastern bank of the Dnieper, and Kiev does not have manpower for a competent landing operation, so the second scenario is more feasible.

The day before, the deputy representative of the Russian Federation at the UN Dmitry Polyansky stated in an interview with the American journalist Kim Iversen that the Ukrainian conflict would soon develop in favor of Kyiv, the 360 ​​television channel reports.

He added that the military of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Armed Forces) in the area of ​​Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut) are already in a deplorable situation. At the same time, Kyiv sends mobilized on the battlefield only two to three days after the start of training. Poorly trained militants literally serve as “cannon fodder”, the Zvezda TV channel reports.

Earlier, on March 14, REGNUM wrote that, according to the forecast of the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence Officer, Scott Ritter, the Armed Forces will be defeated over the next months and will lose hundreds of thousands of people.

A special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an exacerbation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.

«Американские чиновники сосредоточены на подготовке Украины к масштабному весеннему наступлению, которое, как они ожидают, начнется к маю», — говорится в сообщении.

По мнению неназванного чиновника США, пакеты помощи, которые Соединенные Штаты передали четыре-пять месяцев назад, необходимы для контрнаступления украинских бойцов, передает RT.

В материале отмечается, что на Украину направляются сотни западных танков и бронемашин. Также США и европейские партнеры поставляют огромные объемы боеприпасов и 155-миллиметровых снарядов, передает НСН.

Также он добавил, что пока у Киева нет стратегии по поводу наступления, однако существуют два варианта. Первый заключается в продвижении на юг в Крым через Херсон. Второй — двигаться на восток со своих позиций на севере, а затем на юг, чтобы отрезать сухопутный мост РФ, сообщается на сайте kp.ru.

Американские чиновники считают, что первый вариант развития событий является не очень реалистичным в связи с тем, что российские войска укрепили оборону на восточном берегу Днепра, а у Киева нет живой силы для грамотной десантной операции, поэтому второй вариант развития событий является более осуществимым.

Накануне заместитель постоянного представителя РФ при ООН Дмитрий Полянский заявил в беседе с американской журналисткой Ким Айверсен, что украинский конфликт в скором времени будет развиваться не в пользу Киева, сообщает телеканал «360».

Он добавил, что военные Вооруженных сил Украины (ВСУ) в районе Артемовска (украинское название — Бахмут) уже сейчас находятся в плачевной ситуации. При этом Киев отправляет на поле боя мобилизованных спустя лишь два-три дня после начала тренировок. Плохо обученные боевики буквально служат «пушечным мясом», сообщает телеканал «Звезда».

Ранее, 14 марта, REGNUM писал, что, согласно прогнозу офицера разведки Корпуса морской пехоты США в отставке Скотта Риттера, ВСУ в течение ближайших месяцев потерпят поражение и потеряют сотни тысяч человек.

41,iz.ru,Дорожная связка: ВФУ не смогли деблокировать трассу в Артемовск,"On April 26, the armed groups of Ukraine struck several strokes on the flanks of the Russian group in the area of ​​Artemovsk. The counterattacks of VFU wanted to knock out our troops in their original positions in the village of Khromovo. Then they would have managed to release the road cut on the eve, along which the garrison was supplied in the city. Experts note that for him the enemy will fight to the last, since after his fall in the Ukrainian defensive line the hole is formed, and there will be nothing to fill it. On the same day, 40 Russian troops were released from captivity - they were delivered to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation.

Strong flanks

In the western part of Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut), Russian assault detachments continued active actions to destroy the enemy. The units of the airborne troops and the southern group of troops provided them with support and stopped attempts to counterattack on the northern and southern flanks, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation said.

“In the areas of the settlements of Artyomovskoye, Bogdanovka and the Krasnoye of the Donetsk People’s Republic, air artillery fire was defeated by the units of the 57th motorized infantry and 5th assault brigades of the Armed Forces,” said the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov.

For the day, to support the assault detachments in the Artemovsk area, aviation made four departments, and artillery of the group completed 59 fire tasks.

As sources familiar with the situation told Izvestia, the Ukrainian command does not give up and is trying to straighten the situation in the Artemovsk area. Over the past day, several attempts have been made to counterattack Russian positions in the village of Khromovo. There is the last highway cut by our troops on April 25, leading to Artemovsk. They wanted to drop the Russian Armed Forces to their original positions and unlock the road for the supply of supply to the Artyom Garrison.

The village of Khromovo itself is not yet in the hands of the Russian troops, attempts to storm this settlement are currently being made. The VKS of the Russian Federation acted in the interests of the Airborne Forces and PMCs of Wagner, striking on the discovered Ukrainian reserves, artillery joined in the fight against them. The enemy suffered significant losses in the places of concentration of their units and units, Izvestia sources noted.

In the Donetsk direction, the losses of the VFU, according to the Ministry of Defense, per day amounted to 300 military personnel and mercenaries, two infantry fighting vehicles, four armored vehicles, seven cars, D-20 and MSTA-B, SAU Acacia, as well as one howitzer L118 Great Britain.

The Ukrainian command does everything to hold Artemovsk, military expert Vasily Dandykin told Izvestia.

“They try to keep the city before the start of their widely advertised offensive,” he explained. - They cannot leave Artemovsk, since a hole can be obtained in their defense line, and the front will begin to fall apart. Such counterattacks will last, I think, a few more days. They are very expensive for the enemy. The paratroopers are confidently holding the flanks, our artillery inflicts great losses to them. I am sure that ours will cope with these attacks, and Ukrainian forces will soon be exhausted. They themselves began to call what was happening a ""meat grinder.""

Released

From Ukrainian captivity it was possible to free 40 Russian soldiers, who were in captivity were threatened with mortal danger, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation said.

Aircraft of military transport aviation will be delivered to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation. All of them provide the necessary medical and psychological assistance.

Until this day, the last exchange of prisoners took place on April 10. Then the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation reported the liberation of 106 military personnel.

The return of the scouts

In the Kremennaya area in the Krasnoliman direction, artillery duels do not subside. Periodically, VFU is trying to attack, but our fighters successfully stop such attempts. Izvestia correspondent Dmitry Zimenkin visited this point of the combat contact line and looked at how the battles were going on.

“All night under the Kremennaya VFU“ lit a chandelier ”, and in the morning they showered positions with reactive shells,” said Dmitry Zimenkin.

The fighters in positions are waiting for another artillery in the dugouts. Then they take their places according to the combat schedule in order to cover the return from the intelligence of their two guys.

A machine gun and machine guns are falling on the enemy, someone works from the SVD sniper rifle.

In response, VFU open a strong rifle fire. Using the confusion, the scouts get to our positions intact and unharmed - the enemy managed to deceive.

We depart a little deep into our defense line. Here, fighters are resting after completing tasks. Someone sings the favorite songs of the Lube group.

“The enemy near Kremenni is not only not given any chances for a breakthrough, but he is gradually pushed closer to Seversk,” Dmitry Zimenkin reports.

Lost on the islands

On April 26, at least 460 people and 32 units of military equipment, including howitzers, self -propelled guns and armored vehicles, lost in the zone of special operations in all strategic directions of VFU, the Russian Ministry of Defense said.

In the area of ​​the island of the Veliky Kherson region, two command and observance points of the VFU special operations units are amazed. The air defense at the village of Vegratskoye, Kherson Region, shot down the Su-25 Air Forces of Ukraine.

In addition, in the Kherson region, the Ukrainian radar station of the Zoo Park was destroyed.

In the Kharkov region, the DPR and LPR, the actions of eight Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups are suppressed. In the DPR, the warehouses of artillery ammunition of the 108th brigade of the terror and the 72nd mechanized BFU brigade were destroyed.

An unexpected counterattack

The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation spoke about military personnel who showed courage and selflessness in battles.

Major Vasily Sukhanov correctly distributed the forces of his unit and placed checkpoints, due to which the motorized rifles met the attacking parts of the VFU in advantageous positions and reflected the offensive of superior forces.

During the battle, Vasily Sukhanov determined the location of mortar calculations and Ukrainian artillery systems and coordinated the fire of our artillery on them. Then he found a weak place in the enemy’s constructions and decided to go into a counterattack.

In that battle, Vasily was wounded, but continued to command the unit. The frames of Vasily Sukhanov allowed to suppress the artillery gun, to destroy the fighting vehicle of foreign infantry, a mowing mortar with the calculation of more than 10 militants.

A group of corporal Ivan Khmelinin conducted road reconnaissance for Russian troops leading an offensive. Military engineers found and neutralized more than 30 explosive devices and mines of various classes.","Вооруженные формирования Украины 26 апреля нанесли несколько ударов по флангам российской группировки в районе Артемовска. Контратаками ВФУ хотели выбить наши войска на исходные позиции у поселка Хромово. Тогда бы им удалось деблокировать перерезанную накануне автодорогу, по которой снабжался гарнизон в городе. Эксперты отмечают, что за него противник будет биться до последнего, так как после его падения в украинской оборонительной линии образуется дыра, и ее нечем будет заполнить. В этот же день освобождены из плена 40 российских военнослужащих — их доставили в Москву для лечения и реабилитации.

Крепкие фланги

В западной части Артемовска (украинское название — Бахмут) российские штурмовые отряды продолжали активные действия по уничтожению противника. Подразделения Воздушно-десантных войск и Южной группировки войск оказывали им поддержку и пресекали попытки ВФУ контратаковать на северном и южном флангах , сообщили в Минобороны РФ.

— В районах населенных пунктов Артемовское, Богдановка и Красное Донецкой Народной Республики ударами авиации и огнем артиллерии Южной группировки войск нанесено поражение подразделениям 57-й мотопехотной и 5-й штурмовой бригад ВСУ, — сообщил официальный представитель Минобороны РФ генерал-лейтенант Игорь Конашенков.

За сутки для поддержки штурмовых отрядов в районе Артемовска авиация совершила четыре вылета, а артиллерия группировки выполнила 59 огневых задач.

Как рассказали «Известиям» источники, знакомые с ситуацией, украинское командование не сдается и пытается выправить ситуацию в районе Артемовска. За последние сутки были предпринято несколько попыток контратаковать российские позиции у поселка Хромово. Там находится перерезанная 25 апреля нашими войсками последняя автодорога, ведущая в Артемовск. ВФУ хотели отбросить ВС России на исходные позиции и разблокировать автодорогу для подвоза снабжения артемовскому гарнизону.

Сам поселок Хромово пока не находится в руках российских войск, в настоящее время предпринимаются попытки штурма этого населенного пункта. ВКС РФ действовали в интересах группировки ВДВ и ЧВК «Вагнер», нанося удары по обнаруженным украинским резервам, к борьбе с ними подключилась артиллерия. Противник понес значительные потери в местах сосредоточения своих частей и подразделений, отметили источники «Известий».

На донецком направлении потери ВФУ, по данным Минобороны, за сутки составили до 300 военнослужащих и наемников , две боевые машины пехоты, четыре бронемашины, семь автомобилей, гаубицы Д-20 и «Мста-Б», САУ «Акация», а также одна гаубица L118 производства Великобритании.

Украинское командование делает всё, чтобы удержать Артемовск , рассказал «Известиям» военный эксперт Василий Дандыкин.

— Они стараются удержать город до начала своего широко разрекламированного наступления, — объяснил он. — Они не могут оставить Артемовск, так как в их линии обороны может получиться дыра, а фронт начнет разваливаться. Такие контратаки продлятся, я думаю, еще несколько дней. Они стоят противнику очень дорого. Десантники уверенно держат фланги, наша артиллерия наносит им большие потери. Уверен, наши с этими атаками справятся, а украинские силы скоро выдохнутся. Они уже сами начали называть происходящее «мясорубкой».

Освобожденные

Из украинского плена удалось освободить 40 российских военных , которым в плену грозила смертельная опасность, сообщили в Минобороны РФ.

Самолетами военно-транспортной авиации освобожденных доставят в Москву для лечения и реабилитации. Всем им оказывают необходимую медицинскую и психологическую помощь.

До сего дня последний обмен пленными состоялся 10 апреля. Тогда Минобороны РФ сообщило об освобождении 106 военнослужащих.

Возвращение разведчиков

В районе Кременной на краснолиманском направлении не стихают артиллерийские дуэли. Периодически ВФУ пытаются атаковать, но наши бойцы успешно пресекают такие попытки. Корреспондент «Известий» Дмитрий Зименкин побывал в этой точке линии боевого соприкосновения и посмотрел, как идут бои.

— Всю ночь под Кременной ВФУ «зажигали люстру», а утром осыпали позиции реактивными снарядами , — рассказал Дмитрий Зименкин.

Бойцы на позициях очередную артдуэль пережидают в блиндажах. Потом занимают свои места согласно боевому расписанию, чтобы прикрыть возвращение из разведки двух своих ребят.

На противника обрушивается огонь пулеметов и автоматов, кто-то работает из снайперской винтовки СВД.

В ответ ВФУ открывают сильный стрелковый огонь. Пользуясь сумятицей, разведчики добираются до наших позиций целыми и невредимыми — врага удалось обмануть.

Отходим чуть вглубь нашей линии обороны. Здесь бойцы отдыхают после выполнения заданий. Кто-то поет любимые песни группы «Любэ».

— Противнику под Кременной не только не дают никаких шансов для прорыва, но его постепенно отодвигают ближе к Северску , — передает Дмитрий Зименкин.

Потерянные на островах

26 апреля в зоне спецоперации на всех стратегических направлениях ВФУ потеряли не менее 460 человек и 32 единицы военной техники, включая гаубицы, САУ и бронеавтомобили, сообщили в российском Минобороны.

В районе острова Великий Херсонской области поражены два командно-наблюдательных пункта подразделений сил специальных операций ВФУ. ПВО у населенного пункта Велетенское Херсонской области сбила самолет Су-25 воздушных сил Украины.

Неожиданная контратака

В Минобороны РФ рассказали о военнослужащих, проявивших в боях мужество и самоотверженность.

Майор Василий Суханов грамотно распределил силы своего подразделения и расставил блокпосты, благодаря чему мотострелки встретили атакующие части ВФУ на выгодных позициях и отразили наступление превосходящих сил.

В ходе боя Василий Суханов определил местоположение минометных расчетов и украинских артсистем и скоординировал по ним огонь нашей артиллерии. Затем нашел слабое место в построениях противника и принял решение перейти в контратаку.

В том бою Василий был ранен, но продолжил командовать подразделением. Г рамотные действия Василия Суханова позволили подавить артиллерийское орудие, уничтожить боевую машину пехоты иностранного производства, кочующий миномет с расчетом и более 10 боевиков.

The blow was dealt with a high -precision weapon of sea and ground -based, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported. As a result, the enemy suffered heavy losses and partially lost the administration of the troops. Experts note that in time the blow coincided with the activation of enemy attacks in the zone of special operation. Timely destruction of headquarters will seriously violate the coordination of the offensive of the VFU in the long section of the combat contact line.

To loss of management

On the night of July 1, the Russian armed forces delivered a group blow to the high-precision weapon of sea and ground-based base on the control points of the Donetsk operational-tactical group, the Russian Ministry of Defense said.

The Donetsk operational-tactical group is an analogue of our corps and even more, given the huge number of parts of the amplification concentrated in this area, military expert Vasily Dandykin told Izvestia.

“Maybe this group is now even close to our army,” he explained. - So the destruction of the headquarters of the Donetsk group is very important. Officers who need to be raised for a long time are sitting in them, and their losses, of course, cannot be quickly replenished. But most importantly, after the destruction of the headquarters of this level, the command of the troops is violated on a large section of the combat contact line.

The expert also recalled that on June 27, our army destroyed two Ukrainian generals and up to 50 officers, as well as foreign advisers in Kramatorsk.

“All this will make life easier for our troops at the front line,” he remarked. - The enemy has serious attacks for the second day. Only on weekends he lost more than two battalions in the zone. We can say that the second wave of the Ukrainian offensive began and the blow to the headquarters was more than timely. The next week promises to be very hot - Ukrainian forces are likely to throw the remaining reserves into battle. But we are ready for such a scenario of the development of events.

Previously, headquarters of this level were also blocked. In particular, on April 9, in the area of ​​the village of Veliky Burluk in the Kharkov region, the advanced command post of the operational group of Ukrainian armed groups Kharkov was amazed.

The crew of a helicopter with full weapons and at an extremely low altitude is looking for a target that does not even make out on the horizon. On the frames of objective control provided by the military, two armored vehicles of the armed groups of Ukraine are visible. Our pilots destroy one first, then immediately transfer the sight to the second.

- the wriggling tail of the rocket is visible. And after a moment, the technique scatters into small parts, ”said Daniil Levin.

According to one of the military, now there are a lot of work, every day they destroy the enemy’s military equipment.

-From the 4th, more than 200 units were burned. It happens that the coordinates are given, and it is not clear what to shoot for, because there is a lot of burnt equipment ... just a cemetery, ”he said.

The successes of Russian aviation in the Zaporizhzhya direction are largely the result of high -quality, permanent work. The crews fly out day and night, our military personnel are always in combat readiness.

According to the correspondent, after landing, while the blades still continue to rotate, the fuel is already approaching. Techniques immediately inspect the combat vehicle. Carefully check the engine and blades. As soon as the refueling is made, the ammunition is reloaded.

It is clear and practically without precipitation in Zaporozhye for several weeks - perfect weather for flights. But during the day the temperature rises to 30 degrees.

- How many degrees do you put?

- 19–20.

Several helicopters are sent to any combat mission at the same time, one-necessarily with a search and rescue group on board. If an emergency situation occurs, then a military unit in which there are a couple of doctors provides evacuation to a safe place.

Liquidation of the bridgehead

Within two days - July 1 and 2 - at least 1265 people and 96 units of military equipment, including tanks, howitzers, self -propelled guns and armored vehicles, were lost in the WFU special operation, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation said.

In the Kherson direction, the destruction of the VFU units landing on the island of Antonovsky in the area of ​​the Antonovsky bridge was completed. On June 2, the VFU sabotage group was eliminated while trying to land on two motor boats on the island, as well as the storage of fuel for military equipment of the combined group of Ukrainian troops Zaporozhye.

In the Kharkov region, at the places of unloading at railway stations in the areas of the settlements of Balakley and Chuguev, the military equipment of the VFU delivered from the central and western regions of Ukraine.

Two warehouses of ammunition of the units of the 103rd Brigade of Teroborons, the control points of the 28th and 54th mechanized brigades of the VFU, were destroyed.","Вооруженные силы России уничтожили пункты управления оперативно-тактической группы «Донецк». Удар наносился высокоточным оружием морского и наземного базирования, сообщили в Минобороны России. В результате противник понес большие потери и частично утратил управление войсками. Эксперты отмечают, что по времени удар совпал с активизацией атак противника в зоны проведения спецоперации. Своевременное уничтожение штабов серьезно нарушит координацию наступления ВФУ на протяженном участке линии боевого соприкосновения.

До потери управлением

В ночь на 1 июля Вооруженные силы России нанесли групповой удар высокоточным оружием морского и наземного базирования по пунктам управления оперативно-тактической группы «Донецк», рассказали в Минобороны России.

— Все назначенные объекты поражены. Цель удара достигнута, — сообщил официальный представитель Минобороны РФ генерал-лейтенант Игорь Конашенков.

Как рассказали «Известиям» источники, знакомые с ситуацией, комбинированные удары по пунктам управления и штабам оперативно-тактической группы «Донецк» нанесли серьезные потери противнику. Сейчас он пытается реорганизовать и восстановить частично утраченную систему управления.

Оперативно-тактическая группа «Донецк» — это аналог нашего корпуса и даже больше, учитывая огромное количество частей усиления, сосредоточенных в этом районе, рассказал «Известиям» военный эксперт Василий Дандыкин.

— Может быть, эта группа сейчас по своему составу даже близка к нашей армии, — объяснил он. — Так что уничтожение штабов группы «Донецк» очень важно. В них сидят офицеры, которых надо долго растить, и их потери, конечно, быстро не восполнить. Но самое главное, после уничтожения штабов такого уровня нарушается управление войсками на большом участке линии боевого соприкосновения.

Эксперт также напомнил, что 27 июня наша армия уничтожила двух украинских генералов и до 50 офицеров, а также иностранных советников в Краматорске.

— Всё это облегчит жизнь нашим войскам на передовой, — заметил он. — Противник второй день ведет серьезные атаки. Только в выходные дни он потерял в зоне СВО более двух батальонов. Можно говорить о том, что вторая волна украинского наступления началась и удар по штабам был более чем своевременным. Следующая неделя обещает быть очень жаркой — украинские силы, скорее всего, бросят в бой оставшиеся резервы. Но мы готовы к такому сценарию развития событий.

Ранее штабы такого уровня также подвергались ударам. В частности, 9 апреля в районе поселка Великий Бурлук в Харьковской области был поражен передовой командный пункт оперативной группировки украинских вооруженных формирований «Харьков». А 20 апреля в районе города Константиновки был уничтожен объединенный штаб группировки украинских формирований «Бахмут».

Отбитые атаки

Вооруженные формирования Украины продолжили попытки наступления на южнодонецком, краснолиманском и донецком направлениях, сообщили в российском военном ведомстве 2 июля.

На донецком участке линии боевого соприкосновения велись особо ожесточенные бои.

— В ходе ведения активной обороны подразделениями Южной группировки войск успешно отражено 11 атак противника в районах населенных пунктов Артемовск, Водяное, Новобахмутовка, Северное, Первомайское и Марьинка ДНР, — сообщил в воскресенье Игорь Конашенков.

Днем ранее на этом направлении было отбито 15 атак противника. Кроме того, уничтожены склады боеприпасов трех бригад ВФУ.

На краснолиманском направлении 2 июля группировка войск «Центр» отразила три атаки в районах населенных пунктов Торское в ДНР, Червоная Диброва и Невское в ЛНР.

Также было нанесено поражение скоплениям живой силы и техники противника в районах населенных пунктов Терны, Григоровка и Червоная Диброва. В районе Кузьмино пресечена деятельность диверсионной группы ВФУ.

На южнодонецком направлении группировка «Восток» в течение суток отразила атаку противника в районе населенного пункта Никольское. На Времевском выступе в районе Ровнополя уничтожена украинская диверсионная группа. Кроме того, нанесено огневое поражение скоплению живой силы и техники ВФУ в районе Макаровки.

За двое суток на этих трех направлениях потери противника составили свыше 1100 человек, 79 единиц техники, включая восемь танков.

Сожженная техника

Военный корреспондент «Известий» Даниил Левин побывал на запорожском направлении и смог увидеть, как российские ударные вертолеты бьют по технике противника.

Экипаж вертолета с полным вооружением и на предельно низкой высоте ищет цель, которую на горизонте даже не разглядеть. На кадрах объективного контроля, предоставленных военными, видны две бронемашины вооруженных формирований Украины. Наши пилоты уничтожают сначала одну, затем сразу же переводят прицел на вторую.

— Виден извивающийся хвост ракеты. И через мгновение техника разлетается на мелкие части, — рассказал Даниил Левин.

По словам одного из военных, сейчас работы много, каждый день они уничтожают военную технику противника.

— С 4-го числа больше 200 единиц сожгли. Бывает, выдают координаты, и непонятно, по чему стрелять, потому что очень много сгоревшей техники стоит... Просто кладбища, — рассказал он.

Успехи российский авиации на запорожском направлении — во многом результат качественной, постоянной работы. Вылетают экипажи днем и ночью, наши военнослужащие всегда в боевой готовности.

По словам корреспондента, после приземления, пока лопасти еще продолжают вращаться, уже подъезжает топливозаправщик. Техники сразу осматривают боевую машину. Тщательно проверяют двигатель и лопасти. Как только произведена заправка, перезаряжают боекомплект.

Ясно и практически без осадков в Запорожье уже несколько недель — идеальная погода для полетов. Но днем температура поднимается до 30 градусов.

— А у нас есть кондиционер.

— Даже так?

— Конечно, у нас комфортно.

— Сколько градусов ставите?

— 19–20.

На любую боевую задачу отправляют несколько вертолетов одновременно, один — обязательно с поисково-спасательной группой на борту. Если происходит экстренная ситуация, то эвакуацию в безопасное место обеспечивает военное подразделение, в котором есть пара медиков.

Ликвидация плацдарма

В течение двух суток — 1 и 2 июля — в зоне спецоперации ВФУ потеряли не менее 1265 человек и 96 единиц военной техники, включая танки, гаубицы, САУ и бронеавтомобили, сообщили в Минобороны РФ.

На херсонском направлении завершено уничтожение подразделений ВФУ, высадившихся на острове Антоновский в районе антоновского моста. 2 июня ликвидирована диверсионная группа ВФУ при попытке высадки на двух моторных лодках на остров, а также поражено хранилище топлива для военной техники объединенной группировки украинских войск «Запорожье».

“Now I can definitely declare that more than 75% of the city is under the control of our units,” he said on the air of the Russia 24 television channel.

According to Pushilin, it is too early to talk about the complete liberation of the city, fierce battles are still underway in the western part.

At the same time, the acting head of the DPR said that Wagner PMC employees were hoisted on the building of the Artemovsk administration, which can be considered a formal sign of control over the city.

Earlier on this day, Pushilin said that the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Armed Forces) undermined the administration building in Artemovsk before retreating.

Then, the commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Alexander Syrfa, called the situation in Artemovsk complex, but controlled. He added that the battles are fierce in nature, but the defense continues.

In turn, the Izvestia correspondent Dmitry Astrakhan said on April 6 that the Russian assault groups have already managed to take control of part of Artemovsk, and the city’s advance continues.

«Сейчас я абсолютно точно могу заявлять о том, что более 75% города находится под контролем наших подразделений», — сказал он в эфире телеканала «Россия 24».

По словам Пушилина, пока рано говорить о полном освобождении города, в западной части еще ведутся ожесточенные бои.

При этом врио главы ДНР сообщил, что сотрудники ЧВК «Вагнер» водрузили на здание администрации Артемовска флаг, что можно считать формальным признаком контроля над городом.

Ранее в этот день Пушилин рассказал, что Вооруженные силы Украины (ВСУ) подорвали здание администрации в Артемовске, перед тем как отступить.

Тогда же командующий Сухопутными войсками ВСУ Александр Сырский назвал ситуацию в Артемовске сложной, но контролируемой. Он добавил, что бои носят ожесточенный характер, но оборона продолжается.

В свою очередь, корреспондент «Известий» Дмитрий Астрахань 6 апреля рассказал, что российским штурмовым группам уже удалось взять под контроль часть Артемовска, продвижение вглубь города продолжается.

44,iz.ru,Financial Times указало на опасность контрнаступления для ВСУ,"The Armed Forces of Ukraine (Armed Forces) will fall under intensive shelling by Russian troops during a counterattack. This was reported on May 26 by the FINANCIAL Times.

According to the senior researcher at the Institute for External Policy of Rob Li, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be very difficult to break through the many defensive lines of Russia without severe losses.

He noted that during the counterattack, the Ukrainian military may encounter powerful fortifications specially designed to direct them to areas where they will fall under the intensive fire of the Russian Armed Forces (RF Armed Forces).

At the same time, the expert added, even if Ukrainians can break through the first line of defense, the RF Armed Forces will have enough time to strengthen the following.

Earlier, on May 25, the American military expert Daniel Davis in an article for 19Fortyfive noted that the situation in the Ukrainian conflict is more favorable for Russia. According to him, over the past 15 months, Kyiv suffered four defeats in the battles for Severodonetsk, Lisichansk, Soledar and Artemovsk (Ukrainian name - Bakhmut).

Prior to this, on May 18, the Ambassador of Ukraine to the UK Vadim Zableko said that the West has been making too high rates on the upcoming Ukrainian counter -offset, Ukraine will have to pay a very high price for this military operation. According to him, losses can be too high.

On May 14, the Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky admitted that with an unsuccessful counterattack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, less active countries can reduce help from Kyiv. Zelensky also added that Ukraine has neither intention nor enough weapons in order to strike the territory of Russia.

The in the spring of this year became known about the impending counterattack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Since then, European countries, as well as the United States, have begun to actively increase military assistance to Kyiv. At the same time, due to increased pressure on Ukraine, a number of politicians believe that in the event of a defeat, the country will lose many “allies”.

The decision was made against the backdrop of an exacerbation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.","Вооруженные силы Украины (ВСУ) попадут под интенсивный обстрел со стороны российских войск во время контрнаступления. Об этом 26 мая сообщило издание Financial Times.

По мнению старшего научного сотрудника Института исследований внешней политики Роба Ли, ВСУ будет очень трудно прорвать множество оборонительных линий России без тяжелых потерь.

Он отметил, что в ходе контрнаступления украинские военные могут столкнуться с мощными укреплениями, специально разработанными для того, чтобы направить их в районы, где они попадут под интенсивный огонь Вооруженных сил России (ВС РФ).

При этом, добавил эксперт, даже если украинцы смогут пробить первую линию обороны, у ВС РФ останется достаточно времени для укрепления следующих.

Ранее, 25 мая, американский военный эксперт Дэниел Дэвис в статье для 19FortyFive отметил, что ситуация в украинском конфликте складывается более благоприятно для России. По его словам, за последние 15 месяцев Киев потерпел четыре поражения в боях за Северодонецк, Лисичанск, Соледар и Артемовск (украинское название — Бахмут).

До этого, 18 мая посол Украины в Великобритании Вадим Пристайко заявил, что Запад делает слишком высокие ставки на предстоящее украинское контрнаступление, Украине придется заплатить за эту военную операцию очень высокую цену. По его словам, потери могут быть слишком высоки.

14 мая украинский лидер Владимир Зеленский допустил, что при неудачном контрнаступлении ВСУ менее активные страны могут сократить помощь Киеву. Также Зеленский добавил, что Украина не имеет ни намерения, ни достаточного количества оружия для того, чтобы наносить удары по территории России.

О готовящемся контрнаступлении ВСУ стало известно весной этого года. С тех пор европейские страны, а также США начали активно наращивать военную помощь Киеву. При этом из-за возросшего давления на Украину ряд политиков считает, что в случае поражения страна потеряет многих «союзников».

«Только две оставшиеся дороги соединяют почти окруженный город с остальной территорией, которую контролируют украинцы. И в самом городе русские продвигаются вперед по улицам. Кажется, это лишь вопрос времени, когда они полностью возьмут Бахмут. <…> Многие (украинские боевики. — Ред.) задаются вопросом, зачем они сражаются в Бахмуте», — заявил он.

The day before Prigozhin also reported to be controlled by the eastern part of Artemovsk. He clarified that we are talking about the territory located east of the Bakhmutka River.

On March 8, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed the opinion that Artemovsk can be taken in the near future by Russian forces. Nevertheless, according to the general secretary, this will not necessarily be a turning point in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.

«В район населенного пункта Артемовск (украинское название — Бахмут) отмечено прибытие автобуса с молодыми людьми (около 30 человек), не достигшими совершеннолетия. Установлено, что они прибыли в штурмовой батальон «Айдар» для оказания помощи в ведении боевых действий», — отметил он.

Марочко подчеркнул, что многие из подростков ранее были замечены в молодежном движении националистов и проходили обучение в детских лагерях, направленных на экстремистскую и террористическую деятельность.

Ранее, 8 января, военнослужащая 2-го армейского корпуса ЛНР рассказала, что среди корректировщиков Вооруженных сил Украины (ВСУ) оказались подростки, ранее проходившие детские патриотические лагеря. Также в ЛНР была обнаружена специальная база, на которой проходили мероприятия военно-патриотического характера для украинской молодежи. Здесь детей готовили к осуществлению диверсионной деятельности.

Еще 24 декабря прошлого года экс-советник главы Пентагона полковник Дуглас Макгрегор заявил, что украинские боевики начали мобилизовать подростков и недееспособных граждан из-за огромных потерь. По его данным, украинская армия потеряла около 100 тыс. солдат убитыми и еще около 35 тыс. человек пропали без вести.

Специальная операция по защите Донбасса, о начале которой президент России Владимир Путин объявил 24 февраля, продолжается. Решение о ее проведении было принято на фоне обострения ситуации в регионе из-за обстрелов со стороны украинских военных.

This was stated at a briefing on April 15, the official representative of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov.

“In the Donetsk direction, the most fierce battles continued in the area of ​​the city of Artemovsk. During the active actions <...> Wagner successfully advanced forward, having mastered two quarters on the northern and southern outskirts of the city, ”Konashenkov said.

He pointed out that the Ukrainian militants remaining in the city, retreating, purposefully destroy residential buildings and infrastructure facilities to slow down the promotion of the Russian Armed Forces.

Despite this, units of the airborne troops constrain the enemy on the flanks and support the actions of assault detachments to master the city.

Konashenkov added that operational-tactical aircraft, missile troops and artillery units in three settlements of the Donetsk People’s Republic were amazed at the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Armed Forces).

On April 14, the head of the Wagner PMC Evgeny Prigozhin called the positive aspects of long battles for Artemovsk. According to him, protracted clashes allow the Russian army to accumulate strength, to deal with problems.

Earlier on this day, an employee of the Wagner PMC said that the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation squeezed out Ukrainian units from Artemovsk, clamping them in ticks. He also called on the Ukrainian Armed Forces to escape until the ring around the city closed.

Then, the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, said that the assault detachments of the Wagner PMC are conducting the fighting of high intensity to master the quarters of the western part of Artemovsk.

A special operation to protect Donbass, the beginning of which Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on February 24, 2022, continues. The decision was made against the backdrop of an exacerbation of the situation in the region due to shelling by the Ukrainian military.","Штурмовые отряды ЧВК «Вагнер» овладели двумя кварталами Артемовска (украинское название — Бахмут).

«На донецком направлении наиболее ожесточенные бои продолжались в районе города Артемовска. В ходе активных действий <...> «Вагнер» успешно продвинулись вперед, овладев двумя кварталами на северной и южной окраинах города», — заявил Конашенков.

Он указал на то, что оставшиеся в городе украинские боевики, отступая, целенаправленно разрушают жилые дома и объекты инфраструктуры для замедления продвижения ВС России.

Несмотря на это, подразделения воздушно-десантных войск сковывают противника на флангах и оказывают поддержку действиям штурмовых отрядов по овладению городом.

Конашенков добавил, что оперативно-тактическая авиация, ракетные войска и артиллерийские подразделения в трех населенных пунктах Донецкой Народной Республики поразили подразделения Вооруженных сил Украины (ВСУ).

14 апреля глава ЧВК «Вагнер» Евгений Пригожин назвал положительные стороны длительных боев за Артемовск. По его словам, затяжные боестолкновения позволяют российской армии накопить силы, разобраться с проблемами.

Ранее в этот день сотрудник ЧВК «Вагнер» заявил, что ВС РФ выдавливают украинские подразделения из Артемовска, зажимая их в клещи. Он также призвал боевиков ВСУ бежать, пока кольцо вокруг города не замкнулось.

50,theguardian.com,"Russians near Bakhmut have retreated by up to 2km, Ukrainian official says","A Ukrainian military unit has said it has routed a Russian infantry brigade from frontline territory near Bakhmut, claiming to corroborate an account by the head of Russia’s Wagner group that the Russian forces had fled.

Later on Wednesday, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, said Russian units in some parts of Bakhmut had retreated by up to 2km (1.2 miles) as the result of counterattacks. He did not give details.

Wagner units have led a months-long Russian assault on the eastern city, but Ukrainian forces say the offensive is stalling.

“The special military operation continues. This is a very difficult operation, and, of course, certain goals have been achieved in a year,” the Tass news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying.

“We managed to beat up the Ukrainian military machine quite a bit,” said Peskov, citing Russian missile strikes in Ukraine. “This work will continue”.

His comments did not address claims that Russia’s 72nd Separate Motor-rifle Brigade had abandoned positions on the southwestern outskirts of Bakhmut.

A Russian brigade is typically formed of several thousand troops. Bakhmut is the primary target of Moscow’s huge winter offensive, and the scene of the bloodiest ground combat in Europe since the second world war.

Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, said on Telegram that pro-Kyiv units had not lost a single position in Bakhmut on Wednesday.

The Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has repeatedly accused Moscow’s regular armed forces of failing to adequately support his men, said on Tuesday that the Russian brigade had abandoned its positions. “Our army is fleeing. The 72nd Brigade pissed away 3 sq km this morning, where I had lost around 500 men,” Prigozhin said.

Ukraine’s Third Separate Assault Brigade said on Wednesday: “It’s official. Prigozhin’s report about the flight of Russia’s 72nd Independent Motorised Rifle Brigade from near Bakhmut and the ‘500 corpses’ of Russians left behind is true.”

Ukraine’s eastern military command said the Russian brigade had been heavily damaged, although it said Russia was still trying to capture the rest of the city. “Unfortunately, they have not destroyed the whole [Russian] brigade yet,” Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the command, said in televised comments.

“The situation [in Bakhmut] remains difficult because for the enemy, despite all the white noise Prigozhin is trying to create, it [Bakhmut] is the main direction of attack,” he said.

Early on Wednesday, the Third Separate Assault Brigade, which was formed last year from the nationalist Azov Battalion, reposted a video of one of Azov’s founders, Andriy Biletsky, who said his forces had “defeated” the Russian brigade.

“The attacks were implemented within a territory 3km wide and 2.6km deep, and this entire territory is completely liberated from the Russian occupying forces,” he said.

Since last week, Prigozhin has been threatening to pull Wagner out of Bakhmut unless Russia’s regular armed forces send more ammunition. In his latest remarks on Wednesday, he said his troops were receiving only 10% of the shells they needed.

As well as clashing repeatedly with Russia’s defence ministry, Prigozhin has expressed concerns about a long-promised Ukrainian counteroffensive to recapture some of the territory that Russia occupied after the 2022 invasion.",,,2023-05-10,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/russians-near-bakhmut-have-retreated-by-up-to-2km-ukrainian-official-says,529

52,theguardian.com,Russia-Ukraine war live: Kyiv says ‘sick’ packages sent to its embassies following letter bomb in Madrid – as it happened,"11.18 GMT 17 Ukrainian diplomatic missions receive suspicious packages after letter bomb

The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said that 17 Ukrainian embassies or diplomatic missions around the world have received letter bombs or packages containing animal parts, including cows eyes, in recent days.

In an interview with CNN, he said: “It started with an explosion at the embassy of Ukraine in Spain,” Kuleba said. “But what followed this explosion was more weird, and I would even say sick.”

A letter bomb at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid left a staff member with minor injuries on Wednesday. Others have been sent to the Spanish prime minister, the deputy prime minister and the US embassy.

Ukraine’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said that embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia, Italy and Austria are among those to receive the packages.

When asked who he thought was behind the letters, Kuleba told CNN said: “I feel tempted to say, to name Russia straight away, because first of all you have to answer the question, who benefits?

“Maybe this terror response is the Russian answer to the diplomatic horror that we created for Russia on the international arena, and this is how they try to fight back while they are losing the real diplomatic battles one after another.”

Russia has denied any responsibility for the packages in Madrid. On Wednesday, its embassy in Spain said: “Any terrorist threat or act, even more so directed against a diplomatic mission, is totally reprehensible.”",,"Nadeem Badshah, Harry Taylor, Jonathan Yerushalmy",2022-12-03,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/03/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-oil-output-estimated-to-fall-as-g7-commits-to-price-cap,249
53,theguardian.com,‘We are Russians just like you’: anti-Putin militias enter the spotlight,"As Russian militias opposing the Kremlin readied a daring cross-border raid into the Belgorod region this week, a man with slicked-down hair, in full camouflage and holding an automatic rifle stared into a camera lens.

“We are Russians just like you,” the man said in the video, later posted online. “We are people just like you. We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people so they can travel, study and were just happy in a free country. But this has no place in modern Putin’s Russia, rotten through and through from corruption, lies, censorship, restrictions on freedoms and repression.”

That man was Maximillian Andronnikov, the self-proclaimed commander of the Freedom of Russia Legion, a paramilitary group that, until this week, was chided for its outsized internet and media activity. Under the nickname “Caesar” he has also served as a media spokesperson for the group, which has sought to largely act in the shadows and keep its membership a secret.

But with the raids into southern Russia this week, the spotlight has been turned on both the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps, another group composed of Russians who now say they are fighting against Putin.

Profiles have shown that a number of the Russian guerrillas are veterans of anti-Kremlin groups and many, particularly in the Russian Volunteer Corps, have connections with Russian far-right organisations. In a photo taken last month, Andronnikov stands next to Denis Nikitin, a white nationalist prominent in the MMA fighting scene who heads the Russian Volunteer Corps.

Andronnikov himself was previously a member of the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), an ultranationalist group that is publicly opposed to Vladimir Putin but has also fielded pro-Russian fighters in the war since 2014.

Agentstvo, an independent Russian news agency, earlier this year published a 2011 photograph showing Andronnikov at a Russian march with Denis Gariev, the head of RIM’s paramilitary arm. A member of RIM who knows Andronnikov said that he left the group before the war in Ukraine began in 2014.

Andronnikov, who was born in Sochi and later lived in St Petersburg, was also called as a witness in a 2012 case about an alleged military coup being planned by several men in the Urals city of Ekaterinburg. Andronnikov, who was then the head of a St Petersburg “military-patriotic club”, was not charged in the case.

The plot was linked to Vladimir Kvachkov, a retired colonel and hardliner. He was jailed after members of his group, the People’s Front for Liberation of Russia, were accused of training with crossbows in a plot to overthrow the government.

Andronnikov was working as an archery trainer in 2022 when the war began and quickly left for Ukraine, fighting on Kyiv’s side since and saying earlier this year that his ultimate goal was to remove Putin from power. Prior to the raid, he said he had been fighting near the city of Bakhmut.

“I am a good Russian, and on the other side are bad Russians,” he said in another interview earlier this year. “And I kill them every day.”

The militias also include defected members of the Russian security services. Ilya Bogdanov, a former FSB officer, left Russia for Ukraine in 2014 and barely escaped from a Russian secret services kidnapping attempt in 2019. Video published from the raids this week showed Bogdanov hijacking a Russian BTR-82A armoured personnel carrier during the fighting.

About 10 fighters from the Freedom of Russia Legion and another 30 from the Russian Volunteer Corps fanned out in a field on Wednesday for a press event that also served as a victory lap after the raids, which marked the first sustained fighting on Russian territory since the beginning of the war.

It was the first display of strength by the two organisations, which appear to have access to US-manufactured armoured vehicles and weapons. The White House said that it was looking into reports that the militias used US-supplied M1224 MaxxPro MRAPs, which Russia has said would be tantamount to increased US involvement in the war.

Ukrainian officials have denied any connection to the militias, while taking obvious satisfaction in Russia facing a similar threat to the unmarked soldiers and proxy groups Moscow employed against Ukraine in Crimea and Donbas in early 2014.

One popular joke has been to call the Belgorod region the “Bilhorod People’s Republic”, a reference to the Ukrainian regions that have been captured by Russia.

At one point a plume of smoke is visible, drifting against the backdrop of a huge open mine works.

A Ukrainian medic darts out and peers briefly around the corner of the building as a casualty is brought out on a stretcher. Loaded quickly, the carrier heads away at high speed, coming under Russian artillery fire as it tries to leave the town.

01:08 Drone footage shows Ukrainian medical evacuation from Soledar – video

Pictured in the footage are the ruins of the small Donbas saltmining town of Soledar, and a fleeting scene from a battle where life, death and injury has been measured in the past week in such near and not-so-near misses.

On Friday, as Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had taken full control of the saltmining town, western analysts suggested that, if true, it would be at best a pyrrhic victory, gained at high cost to fighters from the Wagner mercenary group of Yevgeny Prigozhin, who claimed the town had fallen on Wednesday.

Ukrainian officials denied the Russian claim, suggesting they were still holding on and counterattacking, with the Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi reporting “ongoing battles”. Before and after photos give a sense of the destruction:

While the situation on the battlefield remained difficult to verify on Friday, by the week’s end, geolocation of reports by Russian war correspondents from Soledar suggested Russian forces were in control of large parts of the town. Ukrainian forces, however, appeared to remain within Soledar’s municipal boundaries still fighting in the north-west, around the town’s salt mine and railway junction.

Crucially, Ukraine still appears to control the road beyond the town, connecting neighbouring Bakhmut and Soledar with Sloviansk and Kostyantynivka, whose capture would further threaten Ukrainian defenders in Bakhmut. What is clear is that the battle for Soledar and Bakhmut has become emblematic of the current state of the war on Ukraine’s eastern front, and more widely symbolic of the state of Moscow’s offensive.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, promised on Thursday night to provide “everything necessary for battles for Soledar and Bakhmut … promptly and without interruption” as it appeared that even if most of Soledar has indeed fallen, Russian forces will need to actively defend it.

Accounts from both sides have depicted what has been a “hellish” battle, amid claims by some Ukrainian combatants that they have heard Wagner fighters – many of them convicts recruited in exchange for pardons – being told by commanders they will be shot if they retreat.

Oleksandr Pohrebyskyy, a Ukrainian soldier from the 46th airmobile brigade recently evacuated from Soledar with hypothermia, described the fighting in an interview this week with Ukrainian Pravda.

Pohrebyskyy described coming across dead Russian fighters who had been killed in their vehicle on an ammunition resupply run: “It was just suicide … When we approached them, the dead, we saw that the driver and other soldiers were without body armour, without helmets, with one magazine in the machine gun. In the very close infantry battles, we heard their commanders shouting: ‘Not a step back. We will shoot.’ We heard and saw it with our own eyes.”

In an interview with Radio NV, Yevhen Dykiy, a former commander with the Aidar battalion, described the experiences of some of his former comrades in the house to house fighting. “One of my friends fought directly inside a school: one wing of the school was ours, and another wing of the school was under the control of the invaders. There was a fight both in the school’s corridors and in the gym.”

Soledar’s fall – if confirmed – would be a propaganda prize for the Kremlin, which has had little good battlefield news in recent months, but the significance beyond that is unclear.

While most analysts believe Russia’s ultimate objective in Soledar to be the weakening of Ukrainian defences around Bakhmut, permitting its further encirclement, the cost so far in Russian dead has been enormous, with claims that Moscow is losing 100 soldiers a day sometimes. That tactic was spelled out by “Witch” – a female Ukrainian officer – in the Bakhmut sector as she was filmed walking around the city at the end of the week.

“The situation is difficult in Soledar right now. I’ll explain why. The enemy is unable to directly assault [Bakhmut] from the front. So they decided to come in from the flanks [Soledar], counting on the flank as not being so [reliably defended]. That’s what they’re counting on.”

The Institute for the Study of War was sceptical about the advantage gained by Russian forces.

“Russian information operations have over-exaggerated the importance of Soledar, which is at best a Russian pyrrhic tactical victory,” it said in a recent update. “[We] continue to assess that the capture of Soledar – a settlement smaller than 5.5 sq miles – will not enable Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut nor better position Russian forces to encircle the city in the short term.”

The fighting for Soledar has also highlighted the increasingly toxic rivalries and dysfunctional relationships between the Russian defence ministry leadership and the Wagner group’s founder, Prigozhin, who has has played an increasingly visible role in Ukraine.

His premature statement on Wednesday that Soledar was won exclusively by Wagner was challenged by accounts from the defence ministry, which described action by airborne troops and other forces in the battle for Soledar. Some analysts have suggested that Vladimir Putin’s shakeup of the military leadership this week was in part an attempt to show that the defence ministry still has his support and is in charge as the troubled conflict nears the 11-month mark.",,Peter Beaumont,2023-01-13,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/13/hellish-battle-soledar-symbolises-russia-war-ukraine,1017
55,theguardian.com,Kremlin spokesperson’s son claims to have fought in Ukraine,"The son of the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has claimed he served as an artilleryman with the Wagner mercenary group in Ukraine for nearly six months.

In an interview with the pro-Kremlin daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, Nikolai Peskov, 33, said: “It was my duty … I couldn’t sit to one side watching as friends and others went off there.”

He added that though it was his own decision to join Wagner, he did not know how to enlist, “so I had to turn to my dad … and he helped me with that”.

Asked about his father’s views of his service, Nikolai said: “He’s proud of me, I think. My father told me that I made the right decision.” Nikolai said he used a false ID so that other Wagner soldiers would not learn of his Kremlin connection.

In a call with journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, a trusted ally of Vladimir Putin, said his son “took part in the special military operation,” but refused to go into detail.

“I would rather not talk about it any more, it has nothing to do with my work,” Dmitry Peskov added.

The Guardian was unable to verify Nikolai Peskov’s claim about serving with Wagner, whose troops have been engaged in intense fighting for months in Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.

Vladimir Soloviev, a prominent state TV host, published a photograph that he said was taken in January in eastern Ukraine and showed a group of masked men, including, according to Soloviev, Nikolai Peskov.

Others have questioned Nikolai’s account. The independent Telegram channel VChK-OGPU said the car belonging to Nikolai Peskov received several speeding tickets in the period when he was supposedly fighting in Ukraine.

The Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said in a video posted on his telegram account that Peskov’s son underwent a three-week training course with Wagner before enlisting with the group as an artilleryman.

“When he left for Luhansk, it was necessary to expand the combined artillery battalion, and he was sent to join an Uragan [multiple rocket launcher] crew,” Prigozhin said, adding that he “showed courage and heroism, just like all the others”.

According to Prigozhin, Dmitry Peskov had asked him to “take Nikolai on as a simple artilleryman”.

Nikolai Peskov, known as Nikolai Choles, was born in 1990 and moved to Britain with his mother, Peskov’s first wife, during the 1990s and later took the surname of his British stepfather.

According to British court documents, in 2010 Nikolai was charged with robbery and causing actual bodily harm to an 18-year-old man in Milton Keynes. He moved back to Moscow in 2012 and got a job at the Kremlin’s English-language television station, RT.

In September 2022, two associates of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny prank-called Nikolai Peskov pretending to be a Russian military official. When asked to report to the military commissariat at 10am the next day, Nikolai said he would “obviously not” do so.

“You must understand it is not right for me to be there. I have to resolve this on a different level,” Nikolai Peskov is heard saying.

It remains unclear whether Nikolai’s reported decision to join the Wagner ranks was a move aimed to boost the Peskov family’s pro-war credentials or stemmed from a real desire to serve in Ukraine.

Nationalist pro-war commentators quickly welcomed the reports. “This is good news,” said Sergei Markov, a pro-Putin political analyst and former Kremlin adviser.

“This will only improve relations between the Russian authorities and the patriotic Russian society,” Markov added.

Since the start of the war, many in the business and political elites have in private criticised the country’s faltering war in Ukraine, resulting in deep suspicion in the FSB about their loyalty.

Some of the discontents came to the surface when Ukrainian media published an alleged recording last month of a conversation between Farkhad Akhmedov, a Russian-Azerbaijani oligarch who is subject to western sanctions, and Iosif Prigozhin, a Kremlin-connected music producer whose wife performed at a pro-war concert alongside Putin last year. Iosif Prigozhin is not related to the warlord Evgeniy Prigozhin.

In the recording, the pair harshly criticised the war in Ukraine as well as Putin personally.

56,theguardian.com,Who is winning in Ukraine – and what will happen next?,"As the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches on Friday, the picture looks very different to the first weeks of the war, when hundreds of Russian tanks poured over the border and airborne forces attempted to capture Hostomel airfield, outside Kyiv, as a springboard to take the capital. Here we look at the status of the conflict and what might happen next.

Is Russia already conducting a new offensive?

There have been contradictory assessments of Russia’s ability to conduct a significant new offensive. Although senior Ukrainian officials have warned repeatedly since before Christmas that Russia was planning a big new effort this year, evidence of preparations for a push similar to that of February 2022, involving a large-scale armoured attack, remains thin.

Recent claims, sourced to Nato officials, that Russia was amassing aircraft, were also largely discounted by the UK’s Ministry of Defence. And while Russia has greatly increased infantry numbers – some estimates suggest more than 300,000 troops are in Ukraine – there is no evidence of hundreds of tanks mustering in a region heavily surveilled by spy satellites.

The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has pointed to increased Russian efforts in the east as evidence that a “new offensive” has begun, but others see it as a continuation of efforts that have been going on for months. Russian shelling is less intense that it was in the summer around Sievierodonetsk, when Moscow was expending 60,000 shells a day.

Despite last year’s mobilisation, analysts such as Phillips O’Brien of St Andrews University believe Russian capabilities are degraded by the war and that those expecting a rerun of the initial invasion last year are wrong.

“What has happened since February 24 is that Ukraine has got stronger and has acquired better systems and is about to get more,” O’Brien says. “The Russians have been getting weaker. They have more soldiers but their equipment is worse, their soldiers are less well-trained than they were, and their ammunition supplies are getting lower.”

O’Brien and others say there is little evidence Russia is any more capable of conducting complex combined arms operations, integrating air power, armour and other elements, than it was a year ago.

What is going on in the east?

One view of fighting in the east – the hottest sector in the conflict – is that increased Russian efforts around the city of Bakhmut amount to so-called shaping operations for a future offensive, perhaps in the spring.

Another is that Russia fears a major new Ukrainian offensive and has increased the tempo of attacks – at an extremely high cost – to tie down Ukrainian forces. A third view is that Russia wants to capture Bakhmut before the 24 February anniversary for propaganda purposes, rather than anything meaningful.

There is probably a little truth in all these views. One caveat is that Russian efforts are not focused solely on Bakhmut but at points along the eastern front, from the border with Kharkiv region down to the occupied south, perhaps to probe for weakness.

06:09 Ukraine's frontline: trench warfare, drones and defending a ghost town – video

Michael Kofman, the head of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses, in Virginia, US, underlined this point on Twitter recently, tweeting: “The Russian offensive consists of about 5-6 axes of attack focused on the Donbas. Rather than a major push along one part of the front, it is instead a series of distributed battles running north-south from Luhansk, to Bakhmut, and southern Donetsk.

“At this stage it doesn’t seem that Russia has employed reserves, and is likely using those units to replace casualties, or perhaps waiting for a breakthrough to exploit. That said, there’s not much evidence of a larger additional Russian force in the waiting.”

What is clear is that the current Russian efforts show the poor leadership, logistics and tactics that have been the hallmark of its operations over the past year, with high casualties for very modest territorial gain.

What about a Ukrainian offensive?

Since its offensives last summer in Kharkiv and Kherson provinces, the pace of Ukrainian operations has been subdued, although Ukraine is continuing to attempt make progress on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River opposite Kherson city.

Moscow has also long anticipated further Ukrainian efforts, especially a push south in the area of Zaporizhzhia.

Ukraine’s political leadership has made no secret of its ambitions to retake Ukrainian territory, including occupied Crimea, and much of its recent diplomacy to secure western arms has been aimed at that.

It has been reasonably effective at misdirecting Russia about its objectives, but it is clear Ukraine has been amassing materiel, including fighting vehicles, and training up forces for its own anticipated operations, while looking for tanks to spearhead some of those assaults.

While Kyiv has made much of its need for 300 main battle tanks, it is worth noting that it conducted effective offensives during the summer that took back large areas without them.

However, some in the west have questioned the advisability of Kyiv committing so much to the defence of Bakhmut and potentially limiting its abilities to conduct a counteroffensive.

That was reflected in briefings to the Washington Post earlier this month expressing concerns that it was “unrealistic to simultaneously defend Bakhmut and launch a spring counteroffensive to retake what the US views as more critical territory”

Who is winning?

There are different ways to assess this. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is close to achieving its stated war aims, which in Ukraine’s case involves liberating all occupied territory.

However, during the past 12 months Moscow has had to repeatedly retreat from its maximalist ambitions – not least deposing the Ukrainian government and imposing a puppet regime – to focus on capturing all of the Donbas, in the east.

Moreover, Russian losses have been huge. A recent estimate by the IISS suggests it has lost 40-50% of its prewar tank fleet. Casualties have also been enormous, with claims last week that Russia was losing 2,000 soldiers for every 100 metres gained in the east. While these figures should be treated cautiously, anecdotal evidence does suggest Ukraine has a lower rate of attrition.

America’s top general, Mark Milley, recently said Russia had already lost tactically and strategically but suggested it was unlikely either side was close to achieving its stated objectives.

It is probably safe to say that the current trajectory of the conflict is going much better for Ukraine than for Russia – and that the continuing influx of new weapons from the west will maintain that trajectory.

But Ukraine, as the EU’s head of foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, warned recently, is heavily dependent on the west for arms, including artillery ammunition, which has exposed a potential vulnerability for Kyiv in the east, where artillery has dominated the battles.

What is also unclear is how much of a gamechanger weapons such as main battle tanks are likely to be in bringing the war towards a close, or how quickly.

57,theguardian.com,Former Wagner Group commander who fled to Norway feared for his life,"A former commander with the Russian mercenary Wagner Group who sought asylum in Norway spoke of how he feared for his life in an interview conducted last month in Russia with the Guardian.

Andrey Medvedev, 26, said that in Ukraine he had witnessed the summary killing of Wagner fighters accused by their own commanders of disobeying orders, sometimes in pairs.

After fleeing his unit, he crossed the border into Norway near the Pasvikdalen valley shortly before 2am local time last Friday, where he was arrested and detained by border guards.

“He has applied for asylum in Norway,” said Tarjei Sirma-Tellefsen, the chief of staff for the police in Finnmark, northern Norway.

Medvedev is the first known soldier from the Wagner Group who fought in Ukraine to flee abroad.

Before he left Russia, Medvedev spoke over several phone calls, in which he described in detail his time fighting with Wagner in eastern Ukraine.

“I fought in Bakhmut, commanding the first squad of the 4th platoon of the 7th assault detachment,” Medvedev said on 20 December, adding that he had hidden in Russia since leaving his Wagner unit in July.

Wagner, run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, has played a key role in the months-long Russian offensive against the east Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

Medvedev said his unit was mostly made up of former prisoners who were thrown into the fighting as “cannon fodder”.

To bolster its ranks, Wagner has recruited as many as 40,000 convicts from prisons across Russia, according to estimates by western intelligence and Russian human rights groups.

“The prisoners are used as cannon fodder, like meat. I was given a group of convicts. In my platoon, only three out of 30 men survived,” he said. “We were then given more prisoners, and many of those died too.”

Medvedev, who grew up in a Siberian orphanage and spent at least four years in prison for robbery, also claimed he knew of at least 10 killings of Wagner soldiers who had disobeyed, and had witnessed some personally.

“The commanders took them to a shooting field and they were shot in front of everyone. Sometimes one guy was shot, sometimes they would be shot in pairs,” he said.

Medvedev described how he grew disaffected with Wagner after witnessing the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners who were brought to the front by Wagner.

“It shocked us to the core, it was so fucked-up.”

He said he decided to flee in early July after his contract was repeatedly extended by Wagner without his consent.

Medvedev also said he had commanded Yevgeny Nuzhin, a convicted murderer recruited by Wagner who surrendered to Ukrainian forces but was later allegedly handed over to Russia and executed.

At the time, Prigozhin issued a statement saying the clip showing Nuzhin killed by a sledgehammer blow to his head should be titled “a dog receives a dog’s death”.

“I fear my fate will be the same as Nuzhin’s for speaking out. I am scared for my life,” Medvedev said in December while hiding in Russia.

He said he was ready to tell everything he knows about the Wagner Group, its activities and Prigozhin.

In a statement published on his social media channels on Monday, Prigozhin confirmed Medevev was a former Wagner soldier.

The human rights group Gulagu.net, which has been in touch with Medvedev since his journey to Norway, also published an interview with Medvedev, where he detailed his dramatic escape. “When I was on the ice [at the border], I heard dogs barking, I turned around, I saw people with torches, about 150 metres [500ft] away, running in my direction,” Medvedev says in one video. “I heard two shots, the bullets whizzed by.”

Medvedev’s Norwegian lawyer, Brynjulf Risnes, told the BBC that Medvedev was being held in Oslo where he faces charges of illegally entering the country.

Risnes said his client was no longer in custody but at a “safe place” while his case was being analysed. “If he gets asylum in Norway that accusation [of illegal entry] will be dropped automatically,” Risnes said.

“He has declared that he is willing to speak about his experiences in the Wagner Group to people who are investigating war crimes,” the lawyer added.

Medvedev’s account is part of a growing body of evidence that sheds light on the activities of the once-secretive Wagner group. The Guardian earlier spoke with Marat Gabidullin, a former Wagner commander who wrote a memoir about his time fighting as part of the group in Syria.",,Pjotr Sauer,2023-01-17,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/17/former-wagner-group-commando-fled-norway-feared-life-russia,754
58,theguardian.com,"Vladimir Putin better informed now about Ukraine war, says US","The head of US intelligence has said Vladimir Putin has “become better informed” about the difficulties facing his invading forces in Ukraine, as the Kremlin suggested the Russian president could visit the occupied Donbas region at a future unspecified date.

Speaking at a defence forum late on Saturday, Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, indicated Putin was no longer as insulated from bad news about the conditions facing his invasion of Ukraine as he was earlier in the campaign.

Alluding to past assessments that Putin’s advisers could be shielding him from bad news, Haines said he was “becoming more informed of the challenges that the military faces”.

“But it’s still not clear to us that he has a full picture of at this stage of just how challenged they are,” she said, addressing an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum in California.

Haines’s comments reflect a wider internalisation of Russian military failures in Ukraine that has increasingly been reflected in remarks made by key regime propagandists, in public opinion polling and in analysis by the Russian military blogger community.

The scale of the challenges facing the Russian president have also been underlined by a series of battlefield setbacks in recent months that have led to the Russians retreating from the Kharkiv region, from Kherson oblast – including the key city of the same name – and from parts of the Russian-occupied Donbas region.

Although Moscow has responded by attacking key Ukrainian civilian energy infrastructure in an attempt to freeze Kyiv into concessions, that campaign, too, has had only a partial impact as Ukrainian engineers have moved quickly to repair damaged power plants and western allies have sent emergency generating plants to help disperse Ukraine’s energy network.

The Kremlin’s vague comments about a potential Putin visit, made on Saturday, appeared designed more for public consumption in Russia than indicating that any visit was imminent.

Making the remarks to Russian news agencies, the Kremlin press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said of any Putin visit: “In due time, this will happen, of course. This is a region of the Russian Federation.”

However, with heavy fighting continuing around the key Donbas town of Bakhmut, where Russian forces have been struggling for six months to make minimal progress, and an attempted Ukrainian offensive reported around Kreminna in recent days, the political and security conditions for a Putin visit appear inauspicious.

Reports on social media also suggested Ukrainian forces were making progress in operations on the east bank of the Dnipro River, opposite the recently liberated city of Kherson, after a reported amphibious landing on the Kinburn Spit last month.

Video and still images posted on Telegram and Twitter show a Ukrainian flag being tied to a crane near the shore in a port area on the east side of the river by a special forces unit, which described the area as “a springboard for the deoccupation of the left [east] bank of the Kherson region”.

While Ukrainian operations east of the river have been under an operational news blackout, Vitaly Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv oblast, has previously confirmed the presence of Ukrainian forces in the area.

Looking ahead to a second winter of fighting in Ukraine, Haines suggested that the fighting was continuing for now at a “reduced tempo”, adding that there could be brighter prospects for Ukrainian forces in the coming months.

“Honestly, we’re seeing a kind of a reduced tempo already of the conflict,” she said, adding that her team expected both sides would look to refit, resupply and reconstitute for a possible Ukrainian counter-offensive in the spring.

“Most of the fighting right now is around Bakhmut and the Donetsk area,” she said. “But we actually have a fair amount of scepticism as to whether or not the Russians will be in fact prepared to do that. And I think more optimistically for the Ukrainians in that timeframe.”

In his nightly address on Saturday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, criticised western efforts to target Russia’s oil industry, a key source of funds for Putin’s war machine, saying their $60-a-barrel price cap on imports of Russian oil was insufficient.

“It is not a serious decision to set such a limit for Russian prices, which is quite comfortable for the budget of the terrorist state,” Zelenskiy said, referring to Russia. He said the $60-a-barrel level would still allow Russia to bring in $100bn in annual revenues.

“This money will go not only to the war and not only to further sponsorship by Russia of other terrorist regimes and organisations. This money will be used for further destabilisation of those countries that are now trying to avoid serious decisions,” Zelenskiy said.

Australia, Britain, Canada, Japan, the US and the 27-nation European Union agreed on Friday to cap what they would pay for Russian oil at $60 a barrel. The limit is due to take effect on Monday, along with an EU embargo on Russian oil shipped by sea.

Russian authorities have rejected the price cap and on Saturday threatened to stop supplying the nations that endorsed it.

59,theguardian.com,Ukrainians defending Bakhmut under severe pressure from Russian onslaught,"Ukrainian forces defending Bakhmut are facing increasingly strong pressure from Russian forces, according to British military intelligence, with intense fighting taking place in and around the eastern city.

Ukraine is reinforcing the area with elite units, while the regular Russian army and forces of the Russian private military Wagner group have made further advances into Bakhmut’s northern suburbs, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its daily intelligence bulletin on Twitter.

The city’s deputy mayor, Oleksandr Marchenko, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is fighting in the city and there are also street fights, but thanks to the Ukrainian armed forces they still haven’t taken control over the city.”

He said of the Russian attack: “Their only goal is killing people and the genocide of the Ukrainian people … the tactic that the Russians are using is the tactic of parched land. They want to destroy Bakhmut, they want to destroy the city … and I honestly can’t understand why they’re doing this.”

He added: “The city is almost destroyed and there’s not a single building that has remained untouched in this war. There are completely destroyed, districts, buildings and apartment blocks.”

Gen Sir Richard Shirreff, a former Nato deputy supreme allied commander for Europe, said if Russia succeeded in taking Bakhmut, it would be a “Pyrrhic victory”.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The Ukrainians have arguably achieved a strategic success thus far in forcing the Russians to expend vast amounts of manpower and equipment in what is likely to be, if they take it, a Pyrrhic victory.”

He urged the supply of equipment and support to Ukraine to be speeded up.

“What we’ve seen from the west and Nato countries is a sort of incremental supply … It’s dribbled in, rather than coming in in a concentrated way,” he said. “If they’d had the stuff that they need months ago, we probably wouldn’t be where we are now. So this places a real imperative on speeding up the supply, the integration, the logistics support, the training and all the other stuff that needs to be done to give the Ukrainians the tools they need to do the job.”

Two key bridges in Bakhmut had been destroyed within the past 36 hours, the defence ministry said, adding that Ukrainian-held resupply routes out of the city were increasingly limited.

One of the bridges connected Bakhmut to the city’s last main supply route from the Ukrainian-held town of Chasiv Yar, about eight miles (13km) to the west, it said.

“The enemy does not cease attempts to surround Bakhmut,” said Ukraine’s military command in its morning briefing note on Saturday, adding that over the past day Ukrainian forces had beaten back Russian attacks in the city.

Russian artillery pounded the last routes out of Bakhmut on Friday, aiming to complete the encirclement of the besieged city and bring Moscow closer to its first major victory in the war in six months.

The Ukrainian briefing note also said Russian attacks had been foiled in the villages of Ivanivske and Bohdanivka, both less than five miles west of Bakhmut’s city centre.

The capture of those villages, which flank the crucial Bakhmut-Chasiv Yar road on either side, would leave the city on the brink of total Russian encirclement.

The battle for Bakhmut has raged for seven months. A Russian victory in the city, which had a prewar population of about 70,000 and has been blasted to ruins in the onslaught, would give Moscow the first major prize in a costly winter offensive, after it called up hundreds of thousands of reservists last year.

Russia says it would be a stepping stone to completing the capture of the Donbas industrial region, one of Moscow’s most important objectives.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has described Bakhmut as a “fortress”.

“Nobody will give away Bakhmut. We will fight for as long as we can. We consider Bakhmut our fortress,” he told a news conference in Kyiv on 3 February.",,,2023-03-04,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/04/bakhmut-ukraine-russia-donetsk-severe-pressure,662
60,theguardian.com,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 346 of the invasion,"The United States has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $2.2bn (£1.8bn) which will include precision-guided rockets and Hawk air defence firing units, as well as other munitions and weapons, the US state department said. Significantly, it includes the ground launched small diameter bomb (GLSDB) for the first time, which will double Ukraine’s strike range and allow Ukraine’s military to strike deep behind the frontlines of the war.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will continue to fight for Bakhmut as long as it can, vowing that “nobody will give away” the eastern “fortress” city. Speaking at a press conference following a summit in Kyiv with European Union leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, Ukraine’s president said the country would be able to begin to liberate occupied Donbas if weapons supplies were “quickened, specifically long-range weapons”.

France and Italy have finalised technical talks for the joint delivery of the Samp/T air defence system to Ukraine in spring 2023, the French defence ministry has announced. It comes after Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said on Thursday that the system would be operational in Ukraine “within seven to eight weeks”. The system can track dozens of targets and intercept 10 at once. It is the only European-made system that can intercept ballistic missiles.

The EU has promised that a tenth package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by 24 February, the first anniversary of the war. The EC president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the package would cover trade worth €10bn (£8.9bn/$10.8bn) and “hit the trade and technology that supports [Russia’s] war against Ukraine”. The next round of EU sanctions, however, is not expected to include nuclear power, which Hungary has already threatened to block.

Air raid sirens twice sounded across Ukraine on Friday as Zelenskiy hosted the EU leaders in Kyiv. The first air alert in Kyiv was on Friday morning. The second, hours later, followed a joint news conference involving Zelenskiy, von der Leyen and Charles Michel. There were no immediate reports of any Russian airstrikes on Kyiv throughout the day.

EU member countries have agreed on a European Commission proposal to set price caps on Russian oil products, the Swedish presidency of the EU said. Ambassadors of the 27 EU states agreed at a meeting on Friday to impose a $100-a-barrel cap on premium products such as diesel and a $45 cap on low-end products, according to diplomats. The price cap comes into effect on Sunday, as does the EU’s ban on Russian oil product imports.

EU leaders offered strong support for Ukraine but set “no rigid timelines” for its accession to the bloc. Zelenskiy had hoped the EU would put Ukraine on a rapid track to membership, but western EU member states are concerned that Kyiv’s expectations on speedy membership talks are unrealistic. “There are no rigid timelines but there are goals that you have to reach,” von der Leyen told the news conference.

An American medic has been killed while working on the frontlines in Ukraine, just weeks after arriving in the country. Pete Reed, 34, was killed on Thursday while he was helping evacuate civilians when his vehicle was reportedly hit by a missile in Bakhmut.

The EU will launch a humanitarian de-mining programme in Ukraine worth €25m, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has confirmed, saying de-mining was “crucial to save the lives of civilian population”.

New tanks supplied by Nato allies will serve as an “iron fist” in a counteroffensive by Kyiv to break through Russian defensive lines, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. Western supplies of 155-mm artillery would be vital for Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the south and in the east, Reznikov said at a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart, Mariusz Błaszczak.

Germany has approved the export of older Leopard 1 battle tanks, which would add to the raft of fighting vehicles Berlin promised last week. A spokesperson said Olaf Scholz’s government had granted an export licence for the German-made tanks first produced in the 1960s and replaced within Germany’s own military by Leopard 2 tanks in 2003.",,,2023-02-04,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-346-of-the-invasion,688
61,theguardian.com,Zelenskiy urges world leaders to act over PoW beheading video,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged international leaders to act after disturbing video emerged on Wednesday of Russian soldiers apparently beheading a Ukrainian prisoner of war lying on the ground.

Ukraine’s president said the world could not ignore the “evil” footage, which has not been verified by the Guardian.

“How easily these beasts kill. We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers,” Zelenskiy said. “There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary.”

The clip appears to show a member of the Russian army using a knife to cut the head off the soldier. It is unclear when or where the video was shot. It may have been filmed last summer, judging by the green foliage in the background.

A second video appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian servicemen lying next to a destroyed military vehicle. A voice says: “They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.”

In a video address on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said the apparent execution was part of a grim pattern, seen in Russian-occupied areas including Bucha, in the Kyiv region, where invading soldiers tortured and killed hundreds of civilians.

“There are no people for them. A son, a brother, a husband, someone’s child. This is a video of Russia just trying to make that the new norm. Such a habit of destroying life,” he said.

Zelenskiy continued: “This is not an accident. This is not an episode. This was the case earlier. This was the case in Bucha. Thousands of times. Everyone must react. Every leader.”

His remarks come amid Ukrainian requests for more western weapons before an imminent counter-offensive. Leaked classified US documents suggest Washington believes Kyiv may be able to make only modest territorial gains, against a dug-in Russian army.

One top secret document says Ukraine faces significant “force generation and sustainment shortfalls”. There are warnings made in February that Kyiv is also running out of ammunition for its Soviet-era air defence systems, which by May could be fully depleted.

Serhi Leshchenko, an adviser to Andrii Yermak, Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, said the gruesome video underscored why more military assistance was needed. “We are not just fighting against the Putin regime but with a terrorist state,” he told the Guardian. “The west needs to help us stop this new Isis.”

He added: “If you can form a coalition against Isis in the Middle East you can do the same against Isis in Europe. Russia is a threat to everybody. One day they will behead victims not only in Bakhmut but in London and New York.”

Zelenskiy promised there would be a legal reckoning for those who carried out the beheading and for multiple other Russian crimes. “The main goal is to win … Defeat of the occupier, sentences to murderers. Tribunal for the evil state,” he said.

The video circulated on Telegram, Twitter and other social media channels, causing revulsion among Ukrainians. The journalist Olga Tokariuk pointed out that Russia was the current chair of the UN’s security council, despite vociferous objections from Kyiv.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said overnight the fighting in the heavily fought over city in Ukraine’s Donbas region is “especially hot”. His comments came as Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin said his troops had raised a Russian flag on the city’s administrative building. However, there was no indication from Ukrainian officials that Bakhmut had fallen into Russian hands and Prigozhin has previously made claims about Wagner’s military progress in the city that were premature.

Russian police have arrested a woman suspected of delivering a bomb that killed a prominent pro-war Russian military blogger in a blast in a cafe in central St Petersburg on Sunday. Russian authorities say Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed by a bomb blast as he was hosting a discussion with other pro-war commentators at a cafe on the banks of the Neva River in the historic heart of St Petersburg.

Russian police said they had identified a woman called Darya Trepova as the suspect, adding that she was arrested in an apartment in St Petersburg after a search on Monday morning. Sources in the country’s interior ministry told the RBK news outlet that the attack was “carefully planned in advance by several people”.

Russian tactical nuclear weapons will be moved close to Belarus’ borders with its Nato neighbours, the Russian ambassador to Belarus has said amid tensions between Russia and the west over Moscow’s war in Ukraine.

Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that in the last 24 hours “the Russian army carried out 29 strikes on 12 populated areas of Donetsk region”. It adds “46 residential buildings, a kindergarten, an administrative building, factory workshops, power lines, gas pipelines and cars were destroyed and damaged.”

The Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting an explosion in occupied Melitopol. It reports the city administration said a car was blown up in the city centre, and that one person was injured. The Telegram channel of the Russian-imposed authority in the city has named the injured person as Maxim Zubarev, the head of the occupying authority in the Yakymivka settlement in the region.

Finland will officially become a member of the Nato military alliance on Tuesday. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said it “will be a good day for Finland’s security, for Nordic security and for Nato as a whole”.

63,theguardian.com,Ukraine has choice of targets as it plots counteroffensive,"After 15 months of fighting, the war in Ukraine is heading towards its most critical point. Kyiv has assembled a force – 12 brigades and perhaps 60,000 troops strong, if leaked Pentagon papers are to be believed – equipped largely with Nato-standard tanks, armour and artillery, and trained in part in the west.

At the same time, Russia’s winter offensive is over and it has failed. The campaign to gain ground along the eastern front from Kreminna in the north, to capture Bakhmut in the centre and Vuhledar in the south is faltering, the culminating point often considered by militaries as the optimum point for a counterattack.

Now Ukraine has to demonstrate, given the western weapons it has received, that is has a path to a military victory, that it can push back the Russian invaders. But the question is: where could it attack?

1. Break the land bridge and isolate Crimea

Ukraine’s advantage, says Ed Arnold, a research fellow at Rusi, the defence thinktank, is that it has choices of where the counterattack could take place. “The hallmark of a good strategy is that it creates options,” he said, and it may even be that Ukraine will press – or appear to press – in a number of locations to try to inflict a serious defeat.

The most obvious point for a Ukrainian attack is to strike from the Zaporizhzhia sector south and south-west towards Melitopol, or possibly south-east towards Berdiansk. The ultimate goal is to cut the road supply links that run close to the coast, but maps of Russian fortifications, based on satellite imagery, show a relatively dense double line of trenches and positions surrounding the key city of Tokmak.

The goal is ultimately to render Russia’s long occupation of Crimea untenable, which could be achieved if the Kerch Bridge, which connects the peninsula to Russia proper, can be blown again – perhaps with the help of newly acquired Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles that could also strike at the key logistics hub of Dzhankoi. But Ukraine knows Russia will fight hard for Crimea, even from a distance, so there may well be advantages to attacking elsewhere.

2. Attack over the Dnipro River into occupied Kherson

A riskier strategy would be to try to launch an amphibious operation across the Dnipro River farther west, where there are fewer but still plenty of fortifications. Britain expanded its programme of training for Ukrainian soldiers in February to encompass marines, and there have been some reports of marines battling to establish bridgeheads in the islands of the Dnipro delta, west of Oleshky.

A significant attack would be “high risk, high reward”, says Arnold, and he argues it is not obvious that Ukraine needs to try something so risky at this point. It is also unclear whether progress across the delta would be straightforward for a significant attacking force. The area is one of the least reported from in the war, making understanding what is happening in the area difficult.

3. Strike into northern Luhansk and threaten to surround forces in Donbas

An alternative to an attack aimed at cutting off Crimea would be to strike into the lightly populated northern Luhansk, aimed at cutting off Russian supply lines that tend to run north-south through Svatove on the frontline and Starobilsk beyond to the east, and in turn threatening Russian-held positions farther south.

The area is less likely to be as well defended, and the aspiration would to achieve a repeat of the September Kharkiv offensive where Ukraine exploited a lightly defended area of the Russian lines farther west, and forced a chaotic retreat on Moscow’s forces who were at risk of being outflanked at points during the speedy advance.

Critical here for Ukraine would be to achieve an element of surprise, and, Arnold says, “having the intelligence to identify a Russian weak spot”. An attack in this area could work opportunistically, if the Russians over-defend in the south, while threatening it could force Moscow to move some troops 200 miles or so north-east.

4. Counterattack around Bakhmut

Six weeks ago, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s land forces, appeared to suggest that Ukraine could strike back in Bakhmut, a previously unimportant Donbas city that has become the scene of the fiercest fighting in the war.

At the time, the idea looked unlikely, but finally in recent days Ukraine has launched some limited counterattacks just north of Bakhmut, and again eight miles (14km) to the south-west. Their tentative success suggests Ukraine could try to encircle the battered city, threatening exhausted Russian forces that have only just captured most of it.

The disadvantage is that for all the symbolic value that would be gained from regaining the lost majority of Bakhmut, the Donbas area is less strategically significant. Cutting into Russian lines in the east does not threaten Crimea and any effort to capture the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, occupied since 2014, would be fraught, not least given the difficulty of urban warfare.

Where an attack in the east could help is “if it fixes the Russians in the area”, Arnold says, meaning it forces Moscow to allocate troops to the eastern front, so giving Ukraine greater opportunity in the south. Probing attacks in Bakhmut could be a prelude to an offensive elsewhere.",,Dan Sabbagh,2023-05-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/12/ukraine-has-choice-of-targets-as-it-plots-counteroffensive,884

The US has halted exports of a slew of consumer goods to Russia including clothes dryers, snow plows and milking machines out of concern the goods may be repurposed to support Moscow’s war in Ukraine. The list of banned consumer goods came as the Biden administration also added 71 companies to a trade blacklist.

Ukraine said on Friday it had repelled attacks by Russian forces trying to recapture land they had lost around Bakhmut, where Kyiv says it has inflicted heavy Russian casualties. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian Wagner mercenary group leading the assault on the devastated eastern Ukrainian city, said in a Telegram message that “heavy, bloody battles” were continuing and claimed his men were close to completing the capture of Bakhmut itself.

Russia has sanctioned former US president Barack Obama in response to the US sanctioning 300 individuals, companies and institutions. The US measures are largely targeted at energy production.

The G7 group of nations has urged Russia to stop its objection to the renewal of the Black Sea grain deal and told it to halt “threatening global food supplies”.

The UK unveiled a swathe of new sanctions ahead of the G7 summit in Hiroshima. Sunak announced a UK ban on imports of Russian diamonds and Russian-origin copper, nickel and aluminium. Sunak also has a self-declared mission to push India into showing greater support for Ukraine.

Hungary has stepped up threats to block further EU funds for weapons to aid Ukraine, marring a show of unity from western nations at the G7 meeting.

Australia has imposed a new set of sanctions and an export ban on Russia. The sanctions will target 21 entities and three individuals, with entities including the major Russian oil company Rosneft, gold company Polyus PJSC, steel company Severstal PJSC and five banks.

The Russian government has put the British prosecutor of the international criminal court, Karim Khan, on a wanted list in an act of retribution after the Hague-based court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin for allegedly overseeing the abduction of Ukrainian children.

Ukrainian air defence claimed it destroyed 19 drones and missiles out of 28 launched on Friday morning. “Three Kalibr missiles launched from the Black Sea and 16 drones were shot down. Shelling continues on an almost daily basis,” a Ukrainian air force spokesperson, Yuriy Ihnat, told Ukrainian television. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, posted to Telegram to say five drones had been shot down overnight above his western Ukrainian region.

Denmark will train Ukrainian F-16 pilots following the US decision to support the training. “Denmark has been working for this together with close allies,” the Nato country’s ministry of defence said.

Vladimir Putin has said the west is trying to break up Russia into different states based on ethnic and national lines. In a speech on Friday the Russian president said the sanctions were helping unite the Russian people rather than divide them. “There are attempts to drive a wedge between peoples of our country. They say Russia should be divided up into tens of different states.”

The Russian security council secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, has claimed the US was involved in the killing of a pro-war military blogger in a bomb blast in St Petersburg in April, and the car bombing of a nationalist writer and politician earlier in May.

More than 100,000 people have enlisted in the Russian army so far this year, former president Dmitry Medvedev has said, as Moscow seeks to recruit volunteers for its offensive in Ukraine.

65,theguardian.com,Putin uses Stalingrad trip to liken Ukraine to second world war,"Vladimir Putin has said Russia is being threatened by German tanks “again” as it was during the second world war, warning that Moscow is ready to respond to aggression from the west.

Speaking at events marking the 80th anniversary of the Red Army’s victory over Nazi Germany in Stalingrad, known today as Volgograd, Putin drew parallels between the Soviet Union’s fight in the second world war and Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine.

“It’s unbelievable but true. We are again being threatened by German Leopard tanks,” he said in the southern city. “Again and again we are forced to repel the aggression of the collective west.”

“We aren’t sending tanks to their borders but we have something to respond with, and it won’t be just about using armoured vehicles. Everyone should understand this,” Putin added. “A modern war with Russia will be completely different.”

Since sending troops to pro-western Ukraine last February, Putin has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons against the west if the conflict escalates.

“Readiness to go until the end, to do the impossible for the sake of the motherland, for the sake of truth was and is in the blood, in the character of our multinational people,” he said.

The 1942-43 Battle of Stalingrad raged for nearly six months and when it was over, the city was in ruins and more than a million soldiers and civilians had lost their lives.

The Red Army’s victory marked a turning point not only for the Soviet Union, which had suffered several heavy defeats, but also for the allied forces.

The commemorations in Volgograd come as the Kremlin looks to step up its offensive in Ukraine, bolstered by tens of thousands of army reservists mobilised last autumn.

Russia has claimed recent gains near the hotspot town of Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine.

Moscow recently announced the capture of the eastern town of Soledar as it seeks to wrest control of the entirety of Donetsk – a region it claims to have annexed. Although the significance of capturing the salt-mining town is disputed, Soledar was the first major victory for Russia’s forces following a series of setbacks on the ground.

On the eve of Putin’s arrival, a bust of dictator Joseph Stalin was unveiled in Volgograd. Since Putin took power in Russia in 2000, a growing chorus of Russians is taking a positive view of the despot’s role in history, and analysts have pointed to the creeping rehabilitation of Stalin in the country.

Nostalgic for the superpower status of the USSR, many Russian officials have been promoting Stalin as a tough leader who led the Soviet Union to victory in the second world war and presided over the country’s industrialisation.

The Soviet Union lost an estimated 20 million people in the war and the legacy of what is known in the country as the Great Patriotic war is venerated.

Officials declared Wednesday and Thursday public holidays in Volgograd following a request from war veterans. The city was renamed Volgograd in 1961, eight years after the death of Stalin.

Since 2013, the city is temporarily renamed Stalingrad several times a year, including on 2 February and on 9 May, when Russia holds nationwide celebrations on the anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war.",,,2023-02-02,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/02/stalingrad-events-see-putin-warn-of-response-to-western-aggression,605

67,theguardian.com,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 379 of the invasion,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it had been “a difficult night” as Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine.

Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles.

Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram.

Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”.

The strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,” the company said in a statement.

In a statement, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. He said: “This is the sixth time that the plant has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run out.”

Zelenskiy has said he will not meet Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.”

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine.

Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans.

The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure.

Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday.

Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter.

The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said on Wednesday.

The founder of the mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, said on Wednesday Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.”

Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing on Wednesday that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut.

The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using The Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers.

Zelenskiy has invited the US House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelenskiy proposed the visit in an interview with CNN on Wednesday.

The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m (£21m), the US justice department said. The district court for the eastern district of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the department said.

In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres.",,Martin Belam,2023-03-09,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-379-of-the-invasion,1116

But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.”

Zelenskiy said the army had combat brigades that were ready, but were still short of promised armoured vehicles, which were slowly arriving. He stressed that Ukraine was not prepared to cede any territory for peace, saying: “Everyone will have an idea. They can’t pressure Ukraine into surrendering territories. Why should any country of the world give Putin its territory?”

Zelenskiy again denied any Ukrainian responsibility for the drone incident over the Kremlin, saying: “They constantly look for something to sound like a justification, saying: ‘You do this to us, so we do that to you.’ But it didn’t work. Even for their domestic public, it didn’t work”. Russia has accused Washington and Kyiv of masterminding the attack, which it described as an assassination attempt on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin was not in the Kremlin at the time, and no injuries were caused by the drones.

A Ukrainian military commander has said that Russian forces in Bakhmut had been pushed back by up to 2km in some areas, after counter offensives. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, made the comments in a post on Telegram. He said: “In some areas of the front, the enemy could not resist the onslaught of the Ukrainian defenders and retreated to a distance of up to two kilometers.”

Russia’s military operation against Ukraine is “very difficult” but certain goals have been achieved, Tass cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying on Wednesday. Russia has succeeded in severely damaging Ukraine’s military machine and this work will continue, he added.

A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil storage depot in the Russian border region of Bryansk, the local governor has claimed in a post on his Telegram channel on Thursday. There were no casualties after the attack on the facility near the town of Klintsy, owned by Russia’s Rosneft oil company, though one storage tank was partially damaged, the governor Alexander Bogomaz said.

Belgorod’s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov has claimed that seven settlements in the Russian region have been left without electricity after Ukrainian shelling over the border.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has claimed that in the last 24 hours Russians have killed three residents of Donetsk region, and wounded two more.

Sweden’s national prosecutor said on Thursday a 50-year-old man had been charged with illegally spreading classified information about a large number of defence installations. Sweden is hoping to be ratified as a member Nato later this year.

Russia’s oil pipeline operator on Wednesday Transneft said that a filling point on the Europe-bound Druzhba pipeline in a border area between Russia and Ukraine had been targeted in a “terrorist” attack, according to the Tass news agency. Transneft said nobody was injured in the incident, which it called a “terrorist attack”, according to Reuters.

France’s anti-terrorism prosecution office on Wednesday announced it had opened an investigation for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity after an AFP video journalist was killed on Tuesday by Grad rocket fire near Chasiv Yar, in eastern Ukraine.

Russian mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin complained Wednesday that his fighters were still not getting enough shells from the official defence ministry. In an audio statement, he said the defence ministry had been holding long meetings on the shell issue but there had been no breakthrough. “We’re not receiving enough shells, we’re only getting 10%,” Prigozhin said, reported Reuters.

New year on Ukraine’s northern frontline

As Ukraine’s most senior defence officials prepare for what they believe will be an attempted second invasion by Russia from the north in the next couple of months, Isobel Koshiw spoke to a unit of Ukrainian territorial defence forces standing guard in their trenches over New Year’s Eve.

She then travelled to Sumy to find out how residents managed to hold back Russian forces, despite the region being bordered by Russia on two sides, to the north and east. On 24 February, when Russia invaded, there were only a few dozen professional soldiers in the north-eastern city, and they had no command centre. That evening, those 50 or so paratroopers were ordered to leave the city – about 20 miles (30km) from the Russian border – for another area. Most of the police force had already fled, along with much of the city’s leadership.

Sumy’s residents were left, confused and in shock, to defend the city on their own as Russian forces rolled towards them. The Sumy self-defence forces – which formed for the most part on the first day of the invasion – managed to hold the city for almost six weeks, despite being encircled. After 6 April, the Russian forces were pushed out of Sumy region, and most of the self-defence force members then joined the army where they are now serving.

A Ukrainian missile strike killed 89 Russian troops

A New Year’s Day attack on a complex in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Makiivka killed scores of recently mobilised troops, in what Pjotr Sauer reported was one of deadliest single strikes against Russia’s forces since the war began. Russia’s defence ministry, in a rare admission on Monday, said 89 Russian soldiers died when Ukraine hit “a temporary deployment facility” with four US-supplied Himars missiles.

Russia’s defence ministry blamed the use of mobile phones by its soldiers for the strike, sparking anger among relatives of the soldiers.

Commenting on the attack, Lt Gen Sergei Sevryukov said in a video statement that a commission was working to investigate the circumstances of what had happened.

“But it is already obvious that the main reason … was the turning on and massive use by personnel of mobile phones within reach of enemy weapons contrary to the ban,” he said, without providing evidence for the claim. Mourners voiced grief and anger at a rare public commemoration in Russia for the slain soldiers.

Ukraine rejected Putin’s 36-hour ceasefire

Ukraine rejected calls from Vladimir Putin for a 36-hour ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas, saying there will be no truce until Russia removes its invading forces from occupied land. Pjotr Sauer reported this story.

The Kremlin said Putin had ordered his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to introduce a temporary ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine for Orthodox Christmas from midday on Friday to midnight on Saturday.

Many Orthodox Christians, including those living in Russia and Ukraine, celebrate Christmas on 6-7 January. Since the war began, some Ukrainians have chosen to celebrate Christmas according to the Gregorian calendar – use by most in the west – rather than the Julian calendar still used by the Russian Orthodox church.

Wagner leader counts cost as Russia stalls in Bakhmut

The head of the Russian Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said his fighters have sometimes spent weeks attempting to capture a single house in the contested Donbas city of Bakhmut, in the latest evidence of how far the Kremlin’s efforts there have stalled, Peter Beaumont and Pjotr Sauer reported.

In a grim video released over new year, Prigozhin – a key ally of Putin – was filmed visiting a basement near the eastern front filled with the bodies of his fighters, many of them convicts, who had been killed during the bitter fighting for the city, a key Russian objective since the summer.

In the makeshift morgue, Prigozhin is seen being shown bodies on stretchers and in body bags. One pile of bagged bodies can be seen stacked shoulder-high in the corner of one of the rooms.

“Their contract has finished, they will go home next week,” Prigozhin can be heard saying, adding: “These are getting ready to be sent. We all work during New Year’s Eve. As more bodies are seen being taken off a truck, Prigozhin can be heard offering new year greetings.

Zelenskiy and Putin signal desire to break deadlock in new year

Russia’s war on Ukraine enters its second calendar year at a delicate point. It is six weeks after the liberation of Kherson and there has been little movement on the frontlines since then. There is not yet any sign of a full, renewed counteroffensive by the Ukrainians, not helped by the weather which has been above freezing, leaving muddy ground not conducive to military manoeuvre.

“The situation is just stuck,” Ukraine’s head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, told the BBC last week, which, if an accurate assessment, is not helpful to Kyiv, which badly needs to retain momentum in the run-up to spring. But the political leadership of both countries has clearly signalled a desire to try to break the deadlock with new goals for the new year, Dan Sabbagh writes.

Whatever Putin might say, the minimal progress in Bakhmut is one of a number of indications that Russia lacks offensive combat power. In a Ukrainian TV interview highlighted by the Institute for the Study of War, Budanov said Russia had gone from firing 60,000 shells a day to “19,000 to 20,000”.

On 4 April, when his city was blockaded on all sides, 16-year-old David boarded a bus from Mariupol to Russia, Isobel Koshiw writes. When asked, he said he told the Russian soldiers exactly what he thought they wanted to hear, “I nodded my head and said ‘Yes, yes, I want to go to Russia’,” said David. “There was no option of going to Ukraine. I thought I’d get [to Russia] and get out quickly via Belarus.”

But when David arrived at the bus’s destination, a city in western Russia, the local authorities sent him to a children’s home because he was under 18. They told him he would have to stay there until he came of age and took away his passport.

David spent eight months living in a Russian children’s home and was only able to get out thanks to a huge effort by his former youth club leaders and a secret network of Russian volunteers, who have been operating in the shadows to help deported Ukrainians leave Russia.

Debate over Banksy murals

A wide-ranging public discussion is taking place in Ukraine over what to do with seven street murals painted in November by the British artist Banksy on a series of destroyed buildings in and around Kyiv, Luke Harding reported.

The conversation has grown urgent after thieves last month made off with one artwork from the town of Hostomel, about 15 miles (25km) outside the capital. It shows a woman in a gas mask and dressing gown holding a red fire extinguisher. She is standing next to a real flame-blackened window.

Banksy painted the image and six others during an unpublicised trip to Ukraine. He later acknowledged in a video that they were his work, done “in solidarity” with the Ukrainian people.

1 Mar 2023 16.38 GMT Germany to increase ammunition production to support Ukraine, says Scholz Germany will ramp up ammunition production as well as ensure it has enough replacement parts and repairs capacity in its defence industry to better support Ukraine, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said. Scholz, after a meeting with Latvian prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, said: The now one-year lasting support of Ukraine has also brought us the knowledge that enables us to ensure that there is also a sufficient supply, with spare parts, that we have created repair capacities for the weapons used in the war, at locations outside of Ukraine. Olaf Scholz at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, on Wednesday. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images He added: We will ensure that the production of ammunition is advanced, both for the weapons that we have supplied ourselves and those that come from classic stocks that are available in eastern Europe. The German leader vowed on Friday to support Ukraine “as strongly and as long as necessary”, adding that German aid to Ukraine, for financial and humanitarian support as well as weapons, had totalled more than €14bn (£12.4bn) so far.

72,theguardian.com,"Ukraine needs more time before its counter-offensive, says Zelenskiy","Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine needs more time before it can launch its much-anticipated counter-offensive against Russia, adding that some armoured vehicles promised by the west have yet to arrive.

The president said newly formed brigades were ready to attack. “We can go forward and be successful. But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.”

Zelenskiy’s comments in an interview with several media outlets including the BBC are the clearest sign yet that a major Ukrainian military push is unlikely to take place in the next few weeks.

Ukrainian commanders have said Kyiv still lacks vital weapons needed for a large-scale campaign to succeed. They include artillery systems with a range of 190 miles (300km), capable of hitting Russian ammunition stores and command centres.

They are increasingly concerned that if the counter-offensive makes only modest territorial gains, Ukraine’s western partners will put pressure on Kyiv to accept an unfavourable peace deal with Moscow.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine was not prepared to cede any land for “peace”. He stressed: “Everyone will have an idea. They can’t pressure Ukraine into surrendering territories. Why should any country of the world give [Vladimir] Putin its territory?”

He also dismissed Russian claims that Ukrainian operatives carried out a drone attack on the Kremlin last week. He described the incident as “very, very artificial” and said it had failed to convince the Russian public and “their own propagandists”.

After a retreat by Russian forces near the eastern city of Bakhmut, Zelenskiy said Moscow was beginning to experience armament shortages on the battlefield. He noted: “They still have a lot in their warehouses, but we already see that they’ve reduced shelling per day in some areas.”

On Thursday, Putin’s press spokesperson conceded that Russia’s months-long attempt to seize Bakhmut had not yet worked. “The special military operation continues. This is a very difficult operation, and, of course, certain goals have been achieved in a year,” Dmitry Peskov said.

Speaking to a Bosnian Serb TV channel, Peskov added: “We manage to beat up the Ukrainian military machine quite a bit. This work will continue.” Peskov said he had no doubt that Bakhmut “will be captured and will be kept under control”.

His comments follow the setback on Tuesday suffered by Russia’s 72nd independent motorised brigade. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, said Russian units in some parts of Bakhmut had abandoned their positions, running away from a counterattack. Ukraine’s army was able to advance by up to 2km on the city’s south-western outskirts, he said.

“It was the competent conduct of the defensive operation that exhausted the trained forces of the Wagner private military contractor and forced them to be replaced in certain directions by less well-prepared units of the Russian regular troops, which were defeated and retreated,” Syrskyi said.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner group, appeared to corroborate the Ukrainian claim in a characteristic video outburst. He said Wagner, which has led the Russian campaign to seize Bakhmut, had sustained huge casualties to take ground, which others then gave up. This week’s retreat was a fiasco, he suggested.

“Our army is fleeing. The 72nd brigade pissed away 3 sq km this morning, where I had lost around 500 men,” Prigozhin said, complaining his troops were receiving only 10% of the shells they needed.

In a statement later on social media, Prigozhin claimed Wagner forces had advanced 170 metres. Ukrainian troops, he said, were confined to an area of 2.25 sq km and were coming under pressure in western districts dotted with high-rise flats.

Prigozhin on Thursday said that Ukrainian operations were proving to be “unfortunately, partially successful”, in an audio message posted on his Telegram channel.

In a later message, Prigozhin said that the situation around Bakhmut flanks was “developing according to the worst of the predicted scenarios.”

He blamed regular the regular Russian army for “abandoning hundreds of meters … practically without a fight.”

01:29 Footage purports to show Russian soldier surrendering to drone near Bakhmut – video

Meanwhile, video footage has emerged on Telegram of a Russian soldier surrendering near Bakhmut after a Ukrainian aerial unit dropped him a note from the sky which read: “Follow the drone!”

The soldier – standing in an exposed trench – spots the drone above him. Sensing it is about to release a grenade, he lays down his weapon and frantically signals that he does not want to be attacked.

The drone unit from Ukraine’s 92nd separate mechanised brigade writes him a message in Russian, telling him to surrender. It drops the paper next to the soldier’s trench. He retrieves it, and indicates that if he gives up his own side will kill him.

A few seconds later he sets off anyway – ducking and running through a network of defensive positions. His fellow Russian servicemen open fire. Remarkably, he survives, reaches Ukrainian lines and is taken prisoner. The extraordinary episode happened on 9 May.

Yurii Fedorenko, the commander of the 92nd mechanised brigade’s drone company, said Russian troops tried to shoot their “own man” in the back. “We accompanied him all the way to Ukrainian positions. Captivity in Ukraine gives you more chances to survive than service in the Russian army,” he said.

The recent territorial gains by Ukraine come amid expectations that Kyiv’s counter-offensive will take place against Russian positions in the occupied south and east of the country. Nine newly formed brigades equipped with western tanks and armoured vehicles have been preparing.

Last autumn, Ukraine’s armed forces recaptured the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson and areas on the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson region, as well as most of Kharkiv region in the north-east, including the cities of Izium and Lyman. Since then, however, Kyiv has made few gains.

In Brussels, Nato’s top military official said the war would increasingly be a battle between large numbers of poorly trained Russian troops with outdated equipment and a smaller Ukrainian force with better western weapons and training. Adm Rob Bauer, a Dutch officer who is chair of Nato’s military committee, said Russia was deploying T-54 tanks – an old model designed in the years after the second world war.",,Luke Harding,2023-05-11,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/11/ukraine-needs-more-time-before-its-counter-offensive-says-volodymyr-zelenskiy,1043
73,theguardian.com,Putin vows to ‘knock down’ US Patriot missiles supplied to Ukraine,"The Kremlin says US supplies of Patriot missiles to Ukraine, agreed upon during Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s trip to Washington, will not stop it achieving its military goals.

Vladimir Putin dismissed the weapon as old and said Russia’s missile systems would be able to shoot it down. “The Patriot air defence is outdated. An antidote will always be found … Russia will knock down the Patriot system,” he declared on Thursday.

The Russian president said “all armed conflicts end through negotiations” – implying that Ukraine would ultimately be forced to cede territory in exchange for peace. “The sooner this becomes clear to Kyiv, the better,” he added.

In a call with reporters, Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there were no signs from Zelenskiy’s meeting on Wednesday with the US president, Joe Biden, that Ukraine was ready for talks.

Peskov suggested the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia and was determined to keep going “to the last Ukrainian”.

During his first foreign trip since the invasion began in February, the Ukrainian president gave a defiant address to a joint session of the US Congress. He said his country would never give in to Russian aggression and that the White House’s continued support was key to ultimate victory.

Zelenskiy received multiple standing ovations as he stressed that the outcome of the war would determine the future world order. “It will define whether it will be a democracy – for Ukrainians and for Americans – for all,” he said. He predicted that 2023 would be a “turning point” in Ukraine’s struggle to liberate its territory.

Biden announced $1.85bn (£1.54bn) in new military assistance to Kyiv, including the delivery of a Patriot missile battery system. Zelenskiy said this would significantly enhance Ukraine’s air defence shield and prevent Russia from hitting critical infrastructure – “our cities, our energy”.

01:22 Biden commits to supporting Ukraine 'for as long as it takes' – video

The success of Zelenskiy’s US trip poses a strategic dilemma for Putin. The US-led, anti-Kremlin coalition is holding up, more than 10 months into the war, contrary to Moscow’s expectations. The latest round of American security assistance will make it hard for Russia to advance in the spring, despite an influx of fresh troops after mobilisation.

On Thursday, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, inspected frontline positions in occupied Ukraine, according to the RIA Novosti state media agency. A video showed him travelling in a convoy of Z-marked armoured vehicles, touring a barracks and talking to soldiers.

Shoigu congratulated soldiers and said: “Everything will be fine.” There was no evidence that the footage was shot in Ukraine, with only muddy fields in the background. Shoigu did not appear to be near the eastern city of Bakhmut, visited by Zelenskiy on Tuesday and the scene of bitter combat.

Ukraine’s ability to launch attacks on high-value Russian targets was demonstrated on Wednesday when one of Putin’s close political allies was seriously injured. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia’s former deputy premier and a hawkish ambassador to Nato, was wounded on a visit to the occupied city of Donetsk.

Russian media reported that he had been sitting in the Shesh-Besh restaurant in the Leninsky district when it was shelled. He was transported back to Russia and taken to hospital in Rostov-on-Don, together with two other victims, his assistant said. He was reportedly waiting for an operation.

In Kyiv, the general staff claimed that Moscow had lost 100,400 troops since late February, as well as more than 3,000 tanks, nearly 6,000 fighting vehicles and 283 planes. The figures are difficult to verify independently. But there is no doubt that the Russian casualty rate is high.

Zelenskiy, meanwhile, went back to Ukraine on Thursday on a US government Boeing aircraft. Elaborate security precautions were taken to protect him on his trip to and from the US. German spy planes and a US air force F-15 fighter jet escorted him over western airspace and he reached eastern Poland by train.

In a video message, Zelenskiy said he was returning home with “good results”. He added: “We are bringing to Ukraine, to Donbas, to Bakhmut and to the south, the decisions that our defence forces have been waiting for.”

The Ukrainian president’s visit lasted less than 12 hours. He had talks with Biden and his most senior national security aides, took part in a joint press conference in the White House’s festively decorated East Room and, on Capitol Hill, met lawmakers including Nancy Pelosi, the outgoing speaker of the House of Representatives.

Despite the overall success of the visit, Zelenskiy did not get everything he wanted. Congress failed to agree a large spending bill, which included nearly $50bn (£42bn) in extra funding for Ukraine, because of a dispute over immigration policy. And the Fox News host Tucker Carlson criticised Zelenskiy for wearing green fatigues to Congress.

There was genuine personal chemistry between Biden and Zelenskiy, but also subtle disagreements over future arms deliveries. In his speech, the Ukrainian president said there should be “no taboos in our relationship”. He said Kyiv did not expect US soldiers to take part in the war: “Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves.”

So far, the Biden administration has not provided longer-range artillery, tanks and fighter jets that would allow Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia. The White House worries that these advanced weapons could escalate the situation and bring the US closer to a direct conflict with Moscow. Kyiv disagrees.

There are also unresolved questions as to what may constitute a Ukrainian victory. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy said he had discussed a 10-point “peace formula” with the US president, which calls on Russia to leave all Ukrainian territory and demands reparations from Moscow, as well as Nuremberg-style trials for Putin and his generals.

Washington has made it clear that it is up to Kyiv to decide what victory means. So far, it has not explicitly endorsed Zelenskiy’s pledge to recapture the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.",,Luke Harding,2022-12-22,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/22/kremlin-says-us-supply-of-patriot-missiles-to-ukraine-will-not-harm-its-military-goals,1087

The deputy mayor of Bakhmut has spoken of the situation in the city saying there is fighting in the streets.

Oleksandr Marchenko told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:

There is fighting in the city and there are also street fights but thanks to the Ukrainian armed forces they still haven’t taken control over the city.

He said of the Russian attack:

Their only goal is killing people and the genocide of the Ukrainian people…the tactic that the Russians are using is the tactic of parched land. They want to destroy Bakhmut, they want to destroy the city…and I honestly can’t understand why they’re doing this.”

Those who are in Bakhmut are living in the shelters “there’s no water or gas or electricity”, he said, but they have been given heaters.

Several civilians were injured in the shelling, including a 13-year-old girl.

New deliveries of western weapons to Kyiv would “deepen the suffering of the Ukrainian people” and would not change the course of the conflict, the Kremlin claimed on Monday. As Ukraine seeks further support from Western allies, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “This supply will not be able to change anything”, according to Reuters.

The Kremlin on Monday rejected a Ukrainian assertion that a senior Russian official has been floating the idea of a potential peace deal over Ukraine with European officials. When asked about the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council Oleksiy Danilov’s assertion that Dmitry Kozak, deputy head of Russia’s presidential administration, had been holding meetings with European officials in an attempt to force Kyiv to sign a peace deal, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was “another fake”.

Russia says it is confident the defence ministry was correct when it said that 600 Ukrainian servicemen had been “destroyed” in an attack on the city of Kramatorsk, despite reporting that showed the attack missed its target. “The Kremlin has absolute confidence, I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the main source of information is the ministry of defence”, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to Reuters.

Ukrainian forces are repelling constant attacks on Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region and holding their positions in nearby Soledar in arduous conditions, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. The Ukrainian president said in his Sunday night video address: “Bakhmut is holding on despite everything. And even though most of the town has been destroyed by Russian strikes, our soldiers are repelling constant Russian attempts to advance. Soledar is holding on, even though there is even greater destruction and things are very difficult.”

78,theguardian.com,Bodies of two Britons killed in Ukraine recovered as part of prisoner swap,"The bodies of two British volunteers killed in Ukraine while carrying out a humanitarian evacuation have been recovered, a Ukrainian official has said.

Chris Parry, 28, and his colleague Andrew Bagshaw, 47, who held dual UK and New Zealand citizenship, had been trying to evacuate an elderly woman from Soledar when their car was hit by an artillery shell.

Their bodies were handed over by the Russians as part of a prisoner of war exchange on Saturday, according to the head of the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office.

Andriy Yermak tweeted: “Another big PoWs swap. We managed to get back 116 of our people. Those are the defenders of Mariupol, Kherson partisans, snipers from Bakhmut vicinities, and other heroes of ours.

“We managed to take the bodies of the foreign volunteers who’d perished, Christopher Matthew Parry and Andrew Tobias Matthew [Bagshaw], as well as the body of Evgen Kulyk, a Ukrainian who’d served with the French Foreign Legion and volunteered to join the Ukrainian forces.”

The two men working as volunteers had been helping people escape from the frontline of the war. They went missing last month while heading to the town of Soledar in the eastern Donetsk region, where heavy fighting was reported.

In a tribute shortly after his death was confirmed by the Foreign Office, Parry’s family said: “His selfless determination in helping the old, young and disadvantaged there has made us and his larger family extremely proud.

“He found himself drawn to Ukraine in March in its darkest hour at the start of the Russian invasion and helped those most in need, saving over 400 lives plus many abandoned animals. It is impossible to put into words how much he will be missed but he will for ever be in our hearts.”

Parry, reportedly a running coach from Cheltenham, previously told Sky News in an interview that he had been driving to towns and villages on the frontline to evacuate people.

He said: “I take each day as it comes. Sometimes when you see some pretty terrible things it does stay with you. But you’ve got a job. You’re in a position of care and as soon as you pick these people up you’ve got to get out and get away from the artillery, which is constantly going off around us.”

Daniel R DePetris

Xi Jinping’s phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy was a long time coming, but it should not have come as a surprise. Beijing is on everyone’s shortlist when it comes to prospective peacemakers in Ukraine. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is no exception. “I know I can count on you to bring back Russia to reason and everyone back to the negotiating table,” Macron told the Chinese leader during their meeting in Beijing this month.

Though Xi replied that he would call the Ukrainian president, he was in no rush. He has no illusions about the difficulty of serving as mediator in a war where Ukraine and Russia are in diametrically opposing positions. Yet China’s recent success in bringing about the normalisation of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia may entice him to help engineer a diplomatic solution to the biggest war fought in Europe since 1945. But what would that solution look like?

The Chinese have repeatedly stressed, most explicitly in the 12-point peace proposal they released on the one-year anniversary of the war, that peace in Ukraine can be restored only through negotiations that “ultimately reach a comprehensive ceasefire”. Despite conventional wisdom, Beijing was not advocating a ceasefire that would freeze the current battle lines as new borders (an arrangement that would leave large swathes of Ukrainian territory in Russian hands), but rather the beginning of a political process that would “ultimately” lead to a permanent cessation of the fighting. Moreover, the proposal said nothing about the territorial terms of a settlement and indeed stressed the need for both sides to show restraint – a formulation repeated in China’s readout of Xi’s conversation with Zelenskiy. Most importantly, it stressed the need to respect the “sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries, regardless of whether they were weak or strong, rich or poor”.

The phraseology is pertinent: China is meticulous about its diplomatic language, especially in public statements. Beijing certainly wants to preserve its “no limits friendship” with Moscow, but has been careful not to adopt a stance so favourable to Russia that Ukraine would be unwilling to accept China as a mediator.

Xi doubtless realises by now that Russia cannot achieve its territorial objectives – which, at minimum, are to partition Ukraine – by winning the war militarily, and that the fighting can only end through an agreement based on mutual compromise by the two parties. As important as Russia is for Beijing, Xi also wants to protect Chinese economic interests in Ukraine over the long term: China remains Ukraine’s largest foreign trading partner and has ploughed money into major infrastructure projects, including the modernisation of Mykolaiv port and the construction of a new subway line in Kyiv.

The US and some of its European allies will probably dismiss Xi’s overtures to Zelenskiy as yet another stunt to obscure Beijing’s political and economic support for Putin during the war – for instance by importing Russian crude oil, which reached a 33-month high in March, and refusing to support UN resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion. This, in part, explains Washington’s rejection of Beijing’s 12-point plan.

Yet China’s careful moves to position itself as the broker of a diplomatic settlement in Ukraine ought not to be dismissed summarily. Xi would not have wasted time having a long conversation with Zelenskiy to no end. Nor would the Chinese have announced their readiness to send “a special representative for Eurasian affairs to Ukraine and other countries” purely as a public relations gambit. China also would not go to such lengths if it didn’t have support from Russia and Ukraine for a diplomatic initiative. Tellingly, Zelenskiy was quick to characterise his call with Xi as “meaningful” and positive, and the Russian foreign ministry commended Xi for his “readiness to strive to establish” a diplomatic track.

We should be under no illusions: while China may be interested in jump-starting a negotiating process between Kyiv and Moscow, reaching an agreement that ends the war will not happen quickly, and it may even be unattainable. Xi can read the battlefield and the positions of the combatants as well as anyone, and he understands the blunt reality that there will be more, not less, war over the short term. The Ukrainian military is in the closing stages of preparing for a major counteroffensive against Russian positions in the south and east. The US and its Nato allies continue to coordinate efforts to ensure that Kyiv possesses the weaponry – including tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, mine-clearing equipment and air defence systems – required for a successful campaign. The Russian military has spent months solidifying its defensive positions in the roughly 20% of Ukraine it controls, even as the Wagner mercenary group tries to capture Bakhmut after an eight-month slog. Neither Ukraine nor Russia will therefore rush to the bargaining table any time soon. And even if they do eventually sit down for talks, efforts at mediation could prove to be a fool’s errand given how far part Russia and Ukraine are on the minimal terms for a deal.

Still, Xi’s call with Zelenskiy, and Kyiv and Moscow’s positive reaction to it, might at least stimulate creative thinking about ways to end the war. Without that, the death and destruction will drag on indefinitely.

82,theguardian.com,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 250 of the invasion,"Russia has launched a wave of cruise missiles at hydroelectric dams and other critical infrastructure across Ukraine on Monday morning, with explosions reported near the capital Kyiv and in at least 10 other cities and regions. Ukraine’s air command said it shot down 44 out of 50 enemy rockets. Video footage suggested that several missiles were intercepted in the skies around Kyiv, soon after 8am local time. Air raid sirens went off nationally, with citizens told to seek shelter.

The governor of Kyiv, Oleksiy Kuleba, said “massive shelling in the region” had damaged electricity and energy infrastructure. He said residents should expert emergency power cuts. He added: “There is currently one victim. We are clarifying the information.”

The cruise missiles were fired from Russian Tu-90 and T-60 aircraft flying north of the Caspian Sea and the Rostov region. They hit targets in Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv oblasts, as well as in the areas of Mikolaiv, Lviv, Zhytomyr, Kirovohrad and Chernivtsi. In a statement on Facebook, Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister described Monday morning’s attacks as “barbaric” and said: “Electric substations, hydropower and heat generation facilities were hit by rockets.

Twelve grain export ships have left from Ukraine today, despite Russia pulling out of the Turkey-UN brokered grain deal, according to Ukraine’s minister of infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov.

Russia called ship movements through the Black Sea security corridor “unacceptable”. “Under the current conditions, there can be no question of guaranteeing the security of any object in the area until the Ukrainian side accepts additional obligations not to use this route for military purposes,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement on Monday.

The UN disputed Moscow’s claim that a civilian cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain may have been involved in a drone strike against Russia. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths said on Monday that no such ships were in the Black Sea’s designated security corridor at the time Russia said the attack had taken place.

Turkey will continue its efforts to support the Black Sea grain export deal despite Russian hesitancy, president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Monday after Russia suspended its participation in the initiative at the weekend.

France is working towards allowing Ukraine to export food supplies via land routes rather than by the Black Sea through Poland or Romania, the French farming minister Marc Fesneau said on Monday.

Norway’s military will be put on a higher level of alert to sharpen its response to the war in Ukraine, its prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre has announced.

Russia has dismissed reports that its agents hacked Liz Truss’s phone, and managed to gain access to sensitive information. When asked about the report, the Kremlin said there was little in British media that could be taken seriously.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy claimed his forces repelled a “fierce offensive” by Russian troops in the eastern Donetsk region. “Today they stopped the fierce offensive actions of the enemy,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night address. “The Russian attack was repelled.” The fiercest fighting in Donetsk region has been around the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka.

Russia’s Black Sea flagship vessel, the Admiral Makarov, was damaged and possibly disabled during an audacious Ukrainian drone attack over the weekend on the Crimean port of Sevastopol, according to an examination of video footage. Open-source investigators said the frigate was one of three Russian ships to have been hit on Saturday. A swarm of drones struck Russia’s navy at 4.20am. Aides to Zelenskiy hinted the country was behind the well-orchestrated raid, though his government has not claimed responsibility.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he was “deeply concerned” by Russia’s suspension of the grain export deal and delayed his departure to attend the Arab League summit in Algiers for a day to try to revive it. Russia requested a meeting on Monday of the UN’s security council to discuss the issue. Guterres was engaged in “intense contacts” to get the agreement back and spoke to the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell.

The security service alleged that Gershkovich “was collecting classified information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military industrial complex.” The Wall Street Journal “vehemently denies” allegations of espionage against Gershkovich, the newspaper said in a statement.

The Moscow court has ordered Gershkovich should be held in pre-trial custody for nearly two months until 29 May, according to a court document. Gershkovich told the court that he was not guilty of espionage, state-run Tass news agency is reporting. A lawyer representing Gershkovich was not allowed to attend the hearing, according to Tass.

Russian forces have had some success in the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut, Ukrainian military officials said on Wednesday evening, adding that their fighters were still holding on in a battle that has lasted several months. The US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War’s regular update appears to support this, saying, “geolocated footage published on March 28 and 29 indicates that Russian forces advanced in southern and southwestern Bakhmut.”

Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow will continue to give the US advance notice about its missile tests despite suspending participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty, reversing a statement he made on Wednesday.

European Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski would support curbs on trading with Ukraine if Poland proposed such a solution, he said on Thursday, amid anger from farmers over the effect of Ukrainian imports on grain prices.

Lawmakers from the pro-Russia, far-right Freedom Party walked out of the lower house of Austria’s parliament on Thursday during a speech by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, protesting that it violated Austria’s neutrality. Austria says its neutrality prevents it from military involvement in the conflict and while it supports Ukraine politically it cannot send the country weapons in its fight against the Russian invasion. The Freedom Party (FPÖ) had warned days before that it would hold some form of protest against the address.

The head of the mercenary Wagner group, which is leading the Russian offensive in Bakhmut, claimed in a video published on Saturday that if his men were forced to withdraw, it could lead to the collapse of the entire Russian frontline.

Ukrainian forces appear to be “conducting a limited fighting withdrawal” in eastern Bakhmut but continue to inflict high casualties on the advancing Russian forces, the US-based Institute for the Study of War says in its latest update.

Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu visited Mariupol, in a rare visit to occupied Ukraine by a senior Moscow figure. The Russian defence ministry issued images on Monday of Shoigu “inspecting Russian reconstruction efforts of infrastructure”. During his visit, it said, he was presented with a medical centre, a rescue centre, and a “new microdistrict” of 12 five-story residential buildings.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has paid tribute to fighters in the Donbas, as his forces come under increasingly intense pressure in the city of Bakhmut. “It is one of the toughest battles. Painful and challenging,” he said in his nightly address.

His comments came after Kyiv said it had repelled “more than 130 enemy attacks” on Sunday as Russian troops continue attempts to surround Bakhmut. Russian forces are said to be contesting lines of communication and preventing resupply.

Zelenskiy also said “the world was strong enough to punish Russia for the war”. Ukraine would spend the next six months working to shore up the country’s energy supply against Russian attack, he said.

The founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that his representative had been denied access to the headquarters of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine after Prigozhin complained about a lack of ammunition.

Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya was handed a 15-year jail term on Monday after being convicted in absentia for treason and “conspiracy to seize power”, a verdict she said was punishment for her efforts to promote democracy. Tsikhanouskaya, 40, a former English teacher, fled to neighbouring Lithuania in 2020 after running against incumbent leader Alexander Lukashenko in a presidential election, which official results claimed Lukashenko won by a landslide. She and the opposition said at the time that the results had been doctored to hand victory to Lukashenko. In 2022, Lukashenko allowed Putin to use Belarus as a springbaord for Russia’s failed offensive to capture Kyiv in the early days of the Russian invasion.

Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, has reported that in the last 24 hours “Russian troops carried out 29 strikes on Donetsk region and shelled 14 settlements in the region”.

Russia’s premier tank force is expected to be re-equipped with Soviet-made T-62 tanks first fielded in 1954 to make up for combat losses, the UK ministry of defence has claimed. In its latest update the ministry says there is a “realistic” possibility” that the 60-year-old tanks will be supplied to units which had been expected to receive the next-generation T-14 Armata main battle tank. The ministry said approximately 800 T-62s have been pulled from storage since 2022.

Russia’s prosecutor general said has said it is labelling German-based anti-corruption group Transparency International an “undesirable organisation”. “It was found that the activities of this organisation clearly go beyond the declared goals and objectives,” it said.

A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson indicated Moscow was unhappy with aspects of the deal, which allowed Ukraine to export grain from ports blockaded by Russia following its invasion.

German chancellor Olaf Scholz told CNN it was “necessary” for Russian president Vladimir Putin to understand he will not win the Ukraine war, so negotiations to end the conflict can begin. “If you look at the proposal of the Ukrainians, it is easy to understand that they are ready for peace,” he added.

The head of the World Food Programme, David Beasley, has warned UK MPs that failing to address issues around food security could lead to additional flows of people out of Syria, Lebanon, and possibly north Africa towards Europe in the next 12 months.

French president Emmanuel Macron urged allies to intensify their military support for Ukraine to help the country carry out a needed counter-offensive against Russia. “We absolutely need to intensify our support and our effort to the resistance of the Ukrainian people and its army and help them to launch a counter-offensive which alone can allow credible negotiations, determined by Ukraine, its authorities and its people,” he said at the Munich security conference.

Allies that can deliver battle tanks to Ukraine should do so now, Olaf Scholz of Germany said at the same event. Germany would facilitate this decision by providing logistics and stock replenishment and by training Ukrainian soldiers, he said, adding: “For me, that is an example of the kind of leadership people can expect from Germany.”

In a statement, the Russian ministry accused Italian authorities of discriminating against Russian artists, without providing further detail.

Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has said that the US is inciting Ukraine to strike directly at Russian territory, after comments by US under secretary of state Victoria Nuland about Crimea. Zakharova said “[The US] supply weapons in huge quantities, provide intelligence, simply participate directly in the planning of military operations, train Ukrainian armed formations. Now the American warmongers have gone even further: they are inciting the Kyiv regime to further escalate, simply to transfer the war to the territory of our country.”

Nuland had told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington the US considers that Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, should be demilitarised at a minimum and Washington supports Ukrainian attacks on military targets on the peninsula.

The first batch of Leopard-1A5 battle tanks the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are buying for Ukraine will be delivered as soon as possible, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said.

At least 16 missiles were shot down by Ukrainian forces, the air force said. Among them, air defences in the south downed eight Kalibr missiles fired from a ship in the Black Sea, the officials said.

Zelenskiy has ruled out giving up any Ukrainian territory in a potential peace deal with Russia. In an interview with the BBC, Ukraine’s leader said conceding land would mean Russia could “keep coming back”. Zelenskiy said a predicted spring offensive had already begun but he believed his country’s forces could keep resisting Russia’s advance until they were able to launch a counter-offensive.

Bakhmut will fall within a couple of months, the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has predicted.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine is committed to defending the embattled city despite a partial encirclement. The Ukrainian president said he had held a meeting with senior generals and commanders in which it was resolved that there was “no part of Ukraine” that “can be abandoned”.

Both Kyiv and Moscow appear to be struggling with ammunition shortages and mounting casualties. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, which is leading the Russian offensive in Bakhmut, said that his representative had been denied access Monday to the headquarters of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine after Prigozhin repeatedly complained about a lack of ammunition.

Ukraine’s ongoing defence of Bakhmut is forcing Russian to engage in a costly battle for a city that “isn’t intrinsically important operationally or strategically”, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

The situation is “stable and controlled” in the Luhansk region the governor, Serhiy Haidai said. In a post on Telegram, Haidai said the number of attacks in the direction of Bilogorivka and Kreminnaya had increased. Tuesday, he said, the Russians have “pulled back to replenish their reserves”.

Ukraine has named the unarmed prisoner of war who appeared to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers, after the president delivered an overnight message resolving to “find the murderers”.

Ukraine has started online talks with partners on extending the Black Sea grain initiative aimed at ensuring Kyiv can keep shipping grain to global markets, a senior Ukrainian government source has said on Tuesday. The source said Ukraine had not held discussions with Russia, which blockaded Ukrainian Black Sea ports after its invasion last year, but that it was Kyiv’s understanding that its partners were talking to Moscow.

Ukrainian forces have taken back about 20 square km (7.5 square miles) of territory from Russian forces around the eastern city of Bakhmut in recent days, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Tuesday.

She said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had advanced “somewhat” in the city of Bakhmut itself, and that heavy fighting continued.

She said: “The enemy is advancing somewhat in Bakhmut itself, completely destroying the city with artillery. In addition, the enemy is raising units of professional paratroopers.

“Heavy battles continue with different results. In the current situation, our troops are doing their best and even more.

“The fact that the defence of Bakhmut lasts for so many months and there are advances in certain areas is the strength of our fighters and the high level of professionalism of the defence command.

89,theguardian.com,Neo-Nazi Russian militia appeals for intelligence on Nato member states,"A neo-Nazi paramilitary group linked to the Kremlin has asked its members to submit intelligence on border and military activity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, raising concerns over whether far-right Russian groups are planning an attack on Nato countries.

The official Telegram channel for “Task Force Rusich” – currently fighting in Ukraine on behalf of the Kremlin and linked to the notorious Wagner Group – last week requested members to forward details relating to border posts and military movements in the three Baltic states, which were formerly part of the Soviet Union.

The news has prompted questions over who has overall command over the far-right pro-Kremlin groups fighting in Ukraine.

Rusich is closely aligned to the Wagner Group, a military outfit run by a close ally of Vladimir Putin and now leading the Russian offensive to capture the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, currently the most fiercely contested battle of the conflict.

Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the “extraordinary” move by Rusich could point to disenchantment with the Kremlin and frustration with how Putin’s war in Ukraine is going.

They added that the Kremlin could lose control of its far-right Russian paramilitary organisations, which may exploit more extreme methods to pursue the Ukrainian war, raising fears of escalation if a Nato state were attacked.

However, sources added it was unlikely that the Kremlin was directly involved because its espionage service would undoubtedly already have intelligence on military and border activity in the Baltic states.

The source said: “Does it indicate fragmentation within the Russian system? What happens if the Russians lose control of them [the paramilitary groups] and they start committing rogue actions that could accidentally escalate the situation? The real question is: how much control does the Kremlin really have?”

Recent reports indicate that some paramilitary groups such as the Wagner Group, founded by the powerful Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, already have considerable autonomy and as much access to Putin as formal government officials.

Although interactions between Rusich and Wagner Group-affiliated online channels have been documented recently, it remains unclear to what extent the group operates with strategic oversight from Wagner or even the Russian defence ministry.

Rusich promotes itself as a sabotage and reconnaissance force, though its frequent crowdfunding efforts suggest it is not effectively supported by Russian logistical operations.

Last Wednesday, the operators of Rusich’s official Russian-language channel on Telegram published a post requesting users in Baltic countries to anonymously share information relating to military and associated infrastructure.

The post, viewed by more than 60,000 users, called for information relating to military units, with specific references to member data and occupations, relatives of members and their personal transport. It also asked for details of patrol movements, and for the locations of border posts, surveillance systems and vehicles.

Details of communication towers and security apparatus on the border, as well as the coordinates of fuel depots and security systems in border areas, were similarly requested.

90,theguardian.com,Russia’s Wagner group signals it will stay in Bakhmut after threat to quit,"The head of Russia’s Wagner group appears to have ditched plans to withdraw his forces from Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, after receiving promises overnight that they would get all the arms needed to capture the devastated city.

Yevgeny Prigozhin announced on Friday that his fighters, who have spearheaded the months-long assault on Bakhmut, would pull out because he said his men had been starved of ammunition and taken “useless and unjustified” losses as a result.

Prigozhin, who has publicly heaped scorn on Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and army top brass over their conduct of the war in Ukraine, said officials in Moscow consumed by “petty jealousy” were holding back crucial supplies to his men.

However, in an audio message posted on his Telegram channel on Sunday, Prigozhin said: “Overnight we received a combat order, for the first time in all this time. We have been promised as much ammunition and weapons as we need to continue further operations. We have been promised that everything needed to prevent the enemy from cutting us off [from supplies] will be deployed on the flank.”

The battle for Bakhmut, which Russia sees as a stepping stone to capturing other cities in Ukraine’s Donbas region still beyond its control, has been the most intense of the conflict, costing thousands of lives on both sides in months of grinding warfare.

Ukrainian troops have been pushed back in recent weeks but have clung on in the city to inflict as many Russian losses as possible before Kyiv’s planned big push against the invading forces along the 620-mile (1,000km) frontline.

Prigozhin also said on Sunday that Russia’s defence ministry had assigned Gen Sergei Surovikin to work alongside Wagner. “This is the only man with the star of an army general who knows how to fight,” he said.

When Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine on 24 February 2022, he flagrantly violated international law and committed a breach of the UN charter. Denying Ukraine’s right to exist, he used massive force to try to erase it from the map of Europe, leaving an ever-increasing trail of gross human rights abuses and war crimes in the process. One year later, Putin has not given up his objective of taking over Ukraine; he believes he has more staying power than Ukraine and the international coalition that supports it.

If he succeeded, Putin would no doubt set his eyes on Moldova and possibly the Baltic states, increasing the risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and Nato. A Russian victory in Ukraine would undermine the rules-based international order and fundamental principles of territorial integrity and national sovereignty, setting a dangerous precedent for territorial conquest elsewhere.

However, if the countries supporting Ukraine adopt the right strategy and remain steadfast in its execution, Putin will fail; he underestimates – totally – the power of freedom. Putin faces brave opposition from pro-democratic forces: in Ukraine, of course, but also in Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Central Asia and even in his own country. Nato is united and stronger than before the conflict, as is the EU. Russian allies such as Iran and North Korea are politically and militarily weaker; China is not willing to provide full support for Putin’s war aims. Freedom exerts a stronger external appeal than tyranny.

Victory is not preordained. Freedom needs to be defended; the Ukrainian freedom fighters need to be supported by all means – including military. At this year’s Munich security conference, transatlantic leaders affirmed that Ukraine “must win this war”. But a declaration of unwavering support is not enough, and actions still fail to match the rhetoric. Current levels of incremental and halting military support will only produce a stalemate on the battlefield.

Putin miscalculated every aspect of the war before launching the full-scale invasion last year. He thought his army was strong, China a solid partner, the west divided and Ukraine contemptible. He could not have been more wrong. Now, his only hope is that his determination is greater than his opponents’, and he can win a war of attrition. We must prove him wrong once more.

We have to go “all in” in our support for Ukraine. The coalition of states supporting Ukraine has delivered an impressive performance, but this is no time for complacency. We have to provide the weapons and ammunition Ukraine needs to fight, and defeat Putin’s war of aggression. The faster Putin understands that he will not achieve his objectives in Ukraine, the earlier peace can be achieved, and the sooner the suffering of the Ukrainian people will end. Ukraine needs the combined force of tanks, longer-range missiles and aircraft to conduct a successful counterattack, paving the way to Ukrainian victory and peace negotiations on acceptable terms.

When speaking about possible peace negotiations, we should be wary of China’s role in this conflict. Beijing is already helping Putin’s war efforts, supplying non-lethal aid and permitting North Korea to transfer weapons to Russia. John McCain’s 2014 prediction that Russia would serve as China’s “gas station” is increasingly true; during Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow, Russia looked content to play the part of China’s junior partner. But we should have no illusions: wary of democracy and Russia becoming an open society, China has every interest in keeping Putin in power.

In order to counter Moscow and Beijing, we have to be much more active outside the transatlantic community. In many parts of the world, China and Russia are successful in convincing governments and publics of their narratives, blaming Nato for the war in Ukraine and accusing US and European allies of neocolonial practices and double standards in their foreign policies. One-off actions will not suffice. Instead, we need to shine a spotlight on Russia’s and China’s malign activity and work on our partnerships with countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia – by constantly engaging with them, continuing to address past failings, and fulfilling the promises we have made, including on climate finance and more inclusive international institutions. After the end of the cold war, many government bodies became non-strategic. To compete successfully in this new era of rising geopolitical tensions, we need to reform our foreign ministries as well as development aid and trade agencies, and better align their efforts.

If the world’s democracies are going to deter and, if necessary, defend themselves against Russia and China, major economies like Germany will have to do their fair share. It is no longer acceptable that Germany and Italy do not spend 2% of their GDP on defence; the 2024 budget will be a litmus test. With regard to France, the move by the defence industry to a “war economy”, as called for by the French government, needs to be genuinely pursued. In similar vein, Europe needs to live up to its decades-old promises of strengthening European defence capabilities. Recent steps such as the EU’s Strategic Compass or the EU’s joint military support of Ukraine point in the right direction, but more needs to follow. This stronger European contribution is also necessary to help preserve bipartisan US support for Ukraine. Putin counts on “Ukraine fatigue” in the US; he needs to be proven wrong.

On the economic front, the EU, the US and international partners implemented stinging sanctions with unprecedented speed; they significantly degraded Russia’s military capabilities and weakened its economic prospects. But, as a global financial centre, the UK has more work to do on sanctions implementation, since the current sanctions regime still has too many holes. By boosting reverse south-north gas flows from suppliers across the Mediterranean, Italy can help strengthen European energy security and mitigate the ripple effects of Russian energy warfare.

Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the erroneous belief that Ukraine would be defeated within a few weeks. More than a year later, Ukraine’s unity and resilience in the face of Russia’s aggression have shown the country’s remarkable strength. Instead of ruling an empire, Putin has become an international outcast, facing an arrest warrant for his war crimes, issued by the international criminal court. To continue its fight for freedom and defeat Putin, however, Ukraine needs more support. Ukraine’s partners have to step up; when freedom is better equipped than tyranny, its victory is assured.

92,theguardian.com,Ukrainian top brass stirs the pot with talk of Bakhmut counterattack,"Spring has arrived in Ukraine – with late March temperatures an unreasonably high 17C along much of the frontline in the east. It means it is possible to declare, definitively, that the Russian campaign to knock out Ukraine’s power grid has failed, and whatever happens next in the war, its people will not be frozen out of their homes, as was once feared when the cynical bombing campaign began on 10 October.

The reality, of course, was the missile strikes on key infrastructure had been largely abandoned at the end of January, with Russian missile stocks at 10-15% of prewar levels, according to Ukrainian estimates. Moscow’s tactics are changing: Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Kyiv’s military intelligence, said in a TV interview that it appeared military fuel and “logistics systems” were now being targeted.

There has been no shortage of bombing and fighting during the long winter, but in another sense little has happened. The battle for the small Donbas city of Bakhmut rages, as it has since May, but in recent weeks Ukraine’s forces have been pushed back north and south of the city, leaving the urban centre increasingly isolated, its supply roads dangerously exposed. Drone footage depicts a battered urban landscape, although many buildings are still standing and troops are able to shelter in basements.

01:10 Ukraine drone footage shows scale of destruction in city of Bakhmut – video

As the weather turns, so too does talk of a Ukrainian counterattack. Kyiv’s forces are gradually taking delivery of previously promised western tanks, fighting vehicles and other munitions, and some of them have been freshly trained in Britain, Germany or Poland. But the country’s second most important commander, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, surprised most observers when he suggested, on Thursday, that the place for a counterstrike could be in or around Bakhmut itself.

The attackers, predicted the commander of the country’s land forces, would “lose strength and exhale” and so “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity”. While a counterattack is anticipated, Bakhmut is not the logical place for it: the city has only modest military value. The principal advantage for Ukraine to defend it is in the belief that doing so will finally bring to an halt the Russian offensive and hand Kyiv back the initiative.

Russian casualties in pursuit of the city amount to 20,000 to 30,000 according to western estimates. While it has been argued that Ukraine has been taking fewer casualties, it is frequently observed that Kyiv is losing some of its best soldiers against former prisoners signed up to fight for the Wagner paramilitary group. A greater risk still is that Russia surrounds Bakhmut, leaving multiple brigades (Syrskyi cited four) besieged in the city, which could force Ukraine to use its western tanks to rescue them.

As for Syrski’s remarks, a more likely interpretation is that the general is engaged in some simple misdirection – a version of maskirovka – a Russian military concept that encompasses western notions of operational secrecy with simple deception. Russia’s military bloggers, most likely to be proxies for its key commanders, are increasingly preoccupied with the potential locations for a Ukrainian spring counteroffensive. Even talking about it in the context of Bakhmut keeps the idea in play.

What are most likely to be Ukrainian probing attacks on the southern Zaporizhzhia front are now getting highlighted by Russian observers, including one at Novodanylivka earlier this week. Trying to cut off the land bridge to Crimea remains Ukraine’s most obvious strategic move, which would be most simply achieved by attacking south on the Zaporizhzhia front – although the obvious counterpoint is that the Russians know the geography too.

A 23-minute video interview with the Wagner group boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, released on Thursday is long on talking up a Ukrainian counterattack, although it appears full of exaggerations and misunderstandings. He suggests Ukraine has a reserve of 200,000, with 80,000 near Bakhmut – numbers Ukraine would be thrilled to have – and that Kyiv could sustain a multi-pronged offensive, even into Russia near Belgorod, which would be an attack that Ukraine’s western backers would almost certainly not support.

The reality is that, as the year-long war has demonstrated, successful attacks are difficult. The protracted defence of Bakhmut shows how hard it is to capture even a small city, while Russia has had ample time to build up its fortifications. For Ukraine to succeed it will want to combine surprise, as it did with the September Kharkiv counteroffensive, with overwhelming force. Ukraine’s commanders may feel they have that already, but it may also be prudent to build up further and wait.",,Dan Sabbagh,2023-03-25,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/25/ukrainian-top-brass-stirs-the-pot-with-talk-of-bakhmut-counterattack,769
93,theguardian.com,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 363 of the invasion,"Russian Preisdent Vladimir Putin has given a long televised national address to the joint houses of the Russian parliament, in which he blamed the west for starting the war in Ukraine, announced Russia would suspend the New Start nuclear treaty with the US, and promised a new fund to help those who had lost loved ones in what he referred to as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Putin claimed the Ukrainian people had become “hostages of their western masters” who occupied the country in political, economic and military terms. He said “the regime is not serving their national interest. They are serving the interests of foreign powers”. He claimed the west is trying to turn a local conflict into a global conflict and “we will react in an appropriate way. We are talking about the existence of our country.”

Referring to the sham referendums held late last year, Putin praised the citizens of occupied Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, saying “You yourself determined your future. You made your choice despite the threats of terror of the Nazis. Next to you there were military actions taking place, and you made the choice to be together with Russia. To be together with your motherland.”

Putin said the west had begun “not just a military, but an economic aggression” against Russia. “They have not achieved success in either of these areas,” he said, boasting that Russia’s economy had restructured and that “the initiators of the sanctions are punishing themselves.”

Ukrainian responses to the speech were scathing. “He is in a completely different reality, where there is no opportunity to conduct a dialogue about justice and international law,” political adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Another adviser, Anton Gerashchenko, said “The insolent thief said that Russian farmers harvested a “record harvest” last year. And he shyly kept silent about the fact that it was stolen Ukrainian grain, which was transported to the Russian Federation by freight trains”. Ukraine’s ambassador to Austria called Putin a liar.

Russian state media websites broadcasting Putin’s address suffered an outage during his speech. The state-run RIA Novosti news agency said the outage was the result of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday Russia’s decision to suspend participation in the New Start bilateral nuclear arms control treaty made the world a more dangerous place, and he urged Moscow to reconsider.

The impact of Russia’s statement that it is suspending nuclear arms control talks is unclear and the US nuclear posture remains unchanged, state department spokesperson Ned Price said on Tuesday.

Russians forces shelled civilian areas of the southern city of Kherson, killing six people and injuring 12 more, at the same time that the Russian president was speaking.

Russia’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had summoned US ambassador Lynne Tracy over what it called Washington’s increasingly “aggressive course”, accusing it of widening its involvement in the Ukraine conflict.

Joe Biden had visited Kyiv on Monday to announce a new package of additional US aid to Ukraine worth $500m (£415m) including artillery ammunition, anti-armour systems, and air surveillance radars. The timing of his visit – before Putin’s address – was seen as a deliberate rebuke of the Russian president.

The US president then arrived in Warsaw late on Monday evening where he is set to meet with Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, along with other leaders of countries on Nato’s eastern flank. The US president will make a speech later today outside Warsaw’s royal castle.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he and Biden spoke about “long-range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine, even though it wasn’t supplied before”. But no new commitments were detailed.

There have been at least 18,955 civilian casualties since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The OHCHR released the report citing the number of casualties as being 7,199 killed and 11,756 injured, but believes the actual figures are considerably higher.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, said on Tuesday that the country’s defence minister and chief of general staff were depriving his fighters of munitions, accusing them of trying to destroy Wagner. “There is simply direct opposition going on,” Prigozhin said in a voice message posted on his Telegram channel. He said it was “an attempt to destroy Wagner” and equated it to treason.

Eighteen Russian MPs are expected to attend a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna on Friday, the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine has already said it will boycott the winter session of the OSCE’s parliamentary assembly at the organisation’s headquarters on 23 and 24 February, saying Russia would use the event to “justify its aggression” and “whitewash war crimes”.

Belarus said on Tuesday that there was a significant grouping of Ukrainian troops massed near its border and warned that this posed a threat to its security. “At present, a significant grouping of the Ukrainian army is concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the Belarusian-Ukrainian section of the state border,” the defence ministry said in a post on Telegram. “The probability of armed provocations, which can escalate into border incidents, has been high for a long time,” it said, adding that it would take “measures to adequately respond.”

Japan is to provide $5.5 billion in financial aid to Ukraine, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said, ahead of a G7 video conference on Friday that will include the Ukrainian president.

The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, is in Kyiv to meet with Zelenskiy, and reiterate Italy’s support for the war-torn country. Tuesday’s trip is seen as one of the most significant made by Meloni since she came to power in October and comes a week after her coalition partner Silvio Berlusconi, the Forza Italia leader, blamed Zelenskiy for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

EU foreign ministers on Monday discussed jointly procuring ammunition to provide to Ukraine during a meeting in Brussels. “It is the most urgent issue. If we fail on that, the result of the war is in danger,” the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said before the meeting. Borrell said the EU needs to ensure that Ukraine has enough ammunition to continue its fight against the Russian invasion, regarding the advance payments scheme as a vital medium-term solution, but wants ammunition delivered from national stocks now.

China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, is expected to visit Moscow with proposals for a political settlement to the war. Over the weekend, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned against Beijing providing material support to Moscow’s invasion, prompting China to tell the US to keep out of its relationship with Russia. “We would like a political solution to provide a peaceful and sustainable framework to Europe,” Wang Yi said ahead of his visit during a stop in Hungary.",,"Samantha Lock, Martin Belam",2023-02-21,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-363-of-the-invasion,1151
94,theguardian.com,‘What was it all for?’: recaptured Lyman left shattered by Russian occupation,"In the shattered streets of Lyman, a Ukrainian city that has lived through the Russian invasion, months of occupation and last week’s brutal battle to liberate it, evidence of the chaotic and bloody Russian withdrawal and defeat is everywhere.

Emerging from the dugout of a former Russian checkpoint on the outskirts of the Donbas city, a Ukrainian soldier appears clasping a Russian copy of Tolstoy’s War and Peace, which he places next to a discarded water bottle cut in half and filled with rifle ammunition. He points inside to an Orthodox icon left pinned to a wall.

The fate of the former occupants of the dugout is unknown: whether they are prisoners now, or were killed in the fighting. Or whether they died during the subsequent pursuit towards neighbouring Kreminna, where a fleeing Russian convoy was shelled relentlessly by Ukrainian forces.

Or perhaps they managed to escape to be chased still further as the Ukrainian counteroffensive continues to push the Russian forces back.

It was not only equipment and personal belongings that were abandoned here. The Russians also left behind their dead to be worried by Lyman’s dogs, bodies that have been gathered by Ukrainian mortuary teams over the past three days.

But it is along the narrow roads outside Lyman where the fighting appears to have been the most intense.

The tarmac is holed and littered with shrapnel and missile casings, burned-out Russian armoured vehicles sit not far from blasted trenches and dugouts. Recently defused anti-tank mines are still visible in some places.

Here, the trees have been splintered and broken like matchwood by rockets and artillery.

Politicians, analysts, and the soldiers who fought in this battle emphasise the importance of Lyman and its railway sidings as the “northern gate” to Luhansk province. But the real meaning is the psychological hit to the morale of Russian troops whose lines have suffered mounting collapses in the east and south.

With Russian forces being pushed ever further back in the sector around Lyman, Ukraine’s military appears to have set its eyes on its next objectives: Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, and the heavily contested Donbas city of Bakhmut where the Russians are still trying to advance.

And crucially the fall of Lyman has also given Ukrainian forces a foothold on the north side of the Siverskyi Donets River.

Occupied until last week by soldiers of the Russian 20th Combined Arms army and Bars-13 troops from the Russian Guard – some of whom had earlier retreated from Kharkiv province – when the attack came they were quickly trapped in a rapidly closing encirclement as the villages outside the city, set among rolling hills, were rapidly rolled up.

What is clear is that Ukraine’s military has found a way of fighting that is far more deft and flexible than the Russians – who are heavily reliant on their creaking supply lines – deploying quickly to cut off, encircle and destroy units piece by piece.

And those Russians who stayed to fight were obliterated by shells and missile fire. Or shot in the forests.

At a junction of a level crossing and a road, the trees around a Russian trench have been swept down as if by a giant hand, the road littered with artillery casings, bits of uniform and human remains.

Surveying the scene, “Flagman”, a Ukrainian officer who has fought in this sector since Russia launched its invasion in February, said that while the Russians relied on the roads, the Ukrainians ambushed them from these woods.

“When they first came, they were a bigger force with heavier weapons. So we withdrew to better lines.

“But after the Ukrainian successes in Kharkiv and Izium in September, their forces pulled back to here although they did not really organise themselves. Then our commanders saw an opportunity to hit them.

“I trained as an officer in the Soviet era, and some of the Russian officers here had the same training.

“They were professional but it was their senior officers who let them down. We know that they asked to withdraw,” he says, confirming UK intelligence reports, “but those higher up didn’t care about their lives. In the end they were too busy with their illegal annexation and their celebrations.

“I don’t think the order ever came to withdraw. In the end they organised themselves to flee despite invitations to surrender.”

Now in the aftermath of the battle, the only remnant of Russia’s imperial ambitions is the graffiti painted on the walls by the former occupiers, the scrawl of “Russia rules!” next to inscriptions of the towns and regions from where the soldiers came.

For the few residents who stayed through it all, the aftermath has been grim.

She says she is exhausted and frightened of an approaching winter in a city without gas and with no windows in her home, words that could sum up the collective mood that seems less euphoric than dejected.

Once a place of about 27,000 people – many of whom worked on the railways – only hundreds remain, moving around the ruined streets by bicycle or on foot.

Many, like Olena, are older, unable or unwilling to flee when the war came.

“It was hard under the Russian occupation,” she says. “My pension didn’t come and we were only given food aid once a month. We didn’t see the Russians soldiers much and when we did there was almost no interaction.

During the battle last week, as Ukrainian forces swept the Russians out in a bloody rout, Olena hid in her basement, only realising it had ended when the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag was raised on a nearby building. “That’s when I knew that it was over.”

The fighting, at least.

Walking with two sticks and with her apartment damaged in the fighting, for Olena the war has not yet gone away, with the sound of booms from the new frontlines in the distance another reminder.

“I want to know,” she asks sadly. “What was it all for?”

In a grocery shop without electricity and half-empty shelves, a few queue for what provisions are available, paying in what money they have – Ukrainian hrvna or roubles imposed by the occupiers.

Outside, a handful of Ukrainian police, freshly returned to the town, patrol the empty streets.

“I came for bread,” says Viktor Serhiiyovych, 75. “But there isn’t any. There used to be a big bakery in the town but it got hit in the fighting. Now it isn’t working.”

Serhiiyovych returned to Lyman not long before last week’s assault after running out of money.

“All we want is a little peace, and a chance to organise our lives and see the town rebuilt. This is only the third day since the Russians left. The fighting was very loud and I hid in my basement. After the fighting started to die down I went to fix my windows, and that’s when I saw the Ukrainian soldiers had come.”

On the road out a military ambulance tries to find its way through a jam on the back roads. As it is waved forward, one of the medics opens a door briefly to check on the casualty inside being jostled through the ruts.

It clears the jam, disappearing into the distance with its siren wailing. Ukraine’s war is far from over.",,Peter Beaumont,2022-10-04,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/04/recaptured-lyman-left-shattered-russian-occupation-ukraine,1311

Three people have reportedly been killed and six injured.

The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not impact its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies.

Olaf Scholz has warned the west to avoid creating a new cold war by dividing the world into blocs. Writing in an opinion piece for Foreign Affairs magazine, published today, the German chancellor called for every effort to be made to build new partnerships. He singled out China and Russia as two countries that pose a threat to a multipolar world.

Nine people have been killed in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk, Russian-backed military officials have said. It came after Ukraine shelled the city of Alchevsk, Reuters reports, citing state-run TASS news agency.

The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed a price cap on Russian oil exports. China, which said it would continue on the basis if respect and mutual benefit, has increased its purchases of Russia’s Urals oil blends this year.

In recent months, the number of sudden troop deployments conducted by Russian tactical combat aircraft over Ukraine has “reduced significantly”, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Russian aircraft now probably conducts tens of missions per day, compared with a high of up to 300 a day in March 2022, the latest British intelligent report suggests.

Vladimir Putin is now “better informed” about the difficulties facing his forces in Ukraine, the head of US intelligence has said. Speaking during a defence forum at the weekend, Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, indicated the Russian president was no longer as insulated from bad news arising from his invasion of Ukraine.

The US expects a “reduced tempo” in fighting to continue over the winter months, adding that there could be brighter prospects for Ukrainian forces in the coming months.

Heavy fighting continues around the key Donbas town of Bakhmut, where Russian forces have been struggling for six months to make minimal progress. Reports on social media suggested Ukrainian forces were making progress in operations on the east bank of the Dnipro River, opposite the recently liberated city of Kherson, after a reported amphibious landing on the Kinburn Spit last month. Russian forces have also intensified artillery attacks on the Kherson region since withdrawing from the western bank of the Dnipro.

A draft resolution is circulating at the United Nations for a Nuremberg-style tribunal to hold Russia accountable for crimes of aggression in Ukraine. Signs also indicate that US opposition to the proposal may be softening in the face of lobbying by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Beth Van Schaack, the US ambassador for global criminal justice, said this week: “So far, all of the [UN general assembly] resolutions on Ukraine have prevailed.

It ascended to a height of 100 metres, buzzing above a field of yellow rapeseed. The drone dropped a dummy anti-tank grenade on to a pile of tyres. The test worked. That night Kostenko’s team repeated the exercise over occupied territory. Two bombs fell on a Russian armoured fighting vehicle. It blew up, smoke pluming into the darkness.

Kostenko, a decorated special forces colonel, said his unit had destroyed dozens of Russian military objects, including tanks and howitzer guns. These operations took place every night on “a tactical level”, he said, close to the frontline. This stretches for 900 miles (1.450km), from the eastern city of Bakhmut where Ukrainian troops launched a local counterattack this week, to the southern provinces of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

There has been intense speculation that Kyiv is about to launch a major counteroffensive. On Thursday night, Russian military bloggers erroneously reported that it had started. Speaking earlier the same day, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his forces needed more time. According to Kostenko, Ukraine’s long-anticipated push should be understood as a rolling “spring-summer campaign” against an entrenched and powerful adversary.

Kostenko said the campaign was already unfolding in stages. The first involved the step-by-step elimination of Russia’s military potential, with strikes against logistical targets such as weapons depots and fuel dumps. This had begun, he said. A second stage involved seeking out and eliminating Russian command and control centres, causing a breakdown of communications with troops in the field. “That’s already happening too, probably,” he said.

Ukraine’s armed forces were unlikely to embark on a major frontal offensive until they had weakened Moscow’s battlefield capability, he indicated. “Our army won’t go forward until this preparation work is done. We can’t win if they have large amounts of ammunition and resources.” He acknowledged that Ukraine was playing a disinformation game about when and where it might strike, with signs that it was working, and that Moscow was beginning to panic.

Kostenko’s comments inject a note of caution into what Ukraine’s army might realistically achieve over the next few months. They raise the prospect that the war could go on for a long time – through 2023, at least, and into next year. Western observers, by contrast, appear to expect a decisive blow. Their optimism comes after Ukrainian operations last autumn in the north-east and south, which liberated large swathes of territory, including the city of Kherson.

Senior Ukrainian officials have warned against exaggerating the likelihood of a repeat breakthrough. In interviews this week, Zelenskiy said some armoured vehicles promised by the west had yet to arrive, and that Kyiv was not prepared to accept a bad peace deal if the counteroffensive failed, or fell short. “We can go forward and be successful. But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time,” the president said.

Kostenko is also a deputy with the pro-European Golos party, and the chair of the Kyiv parliament’s intelligence and security committee. When Russia invaded last February, he led the defence of the southern city of Mykolaiv, and has since worked closely with the drone unit. The unit calls itself Perun, after a pagan god of sky and thunder. It makes its own quadcopters in a workshop, and is engaged in a constant battle of wits with Russian forces, who try to knock out the drones using electronic jamming systems.

According to Ukrainian partisans, spooked Russian soldiers have grown terrified of mysterious nighttime attacks. They have nicknamed the invisible drones Baba Yaga, after the supernatural witch who flies around on a broom. One Ukrainian operator, who uses the codename Caesar, said most missions were successful. The drones were comparatively cheap to build, and frequently knocked out $2m tanks, he said.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive plan is classified, known only to Zelenskiy’s commander-in-chief, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, and a few others. There has been speculation that his troops might try to cross the Dnipro River, where Moscow controls the left bank. Kostenko said “anything was possible” but that the Russians would immediately spot a buildup of Ukrainian forces, and smash them with artillery. “There would be an unacceptable level of casualties,” he said.

In the meantime, Ukrainian and Russian soldiers were skirmishing on islands in the middle of the river. “It’s a grey zone. Nobody controls them. We fire and they fire,” Kostenko said, adding that both sides struggled to defend positions, which were gained and quickly lost, including on Velykyi Potomkin island, next to Kherson, itself the target of daily Russian bombardment. It was impossible to dig trenches because water appeared after only a few feet, he said.

The most obvious area for a Ukrainian attack is the Zaporizhzhia region. According to Russian military bloggers there were no signs on Friday of increased activity. It is widely assumed Ukrainian soldiers will try to recapture the city of Melitopol, and advance towards the ports of Berdiansk and Mariupol. If successful, this manoeuvre would sever Russia’s land corridor, cutting off Crimea and the left-bank of the Kherson region from the occupied east of the country.

Kostenko, however, said the distances involved were formidable. They would require a 40- to 60-mile push into enemy territory. The Russians had dug 6-metre by 3-metre anti-tank trenches and large-scale fortifications – some of the most extensive military defences seen for decades anywhere in the world, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. “It’s hard after a year of war for either side to surprise the other,” Kostenko noted, saying he was lobbying for an attack on Russia itself and the weakly defended border town of Bryansk.

Mines were a further problem, he acknowledged. Russian sappers had mined fields and roads all across the Zaporizhzhia frontline and put floating Yarm mines in the Dnipro River. Paradoxically, it would be easier for Ukraine to advance in Donetsk oblast, the region where Russia has the greatest concentration of forces, but with fewer mines to kill and wound advancing infantry, he said. “Mines are a big risk for us.”

According to leaked Pentagon documents, Ukraine has assembled at least nine new brigades. They are equipped with main battle tanks supplied by western partners, including the UK, which has sent 14 Challenger 2s; 80 Leopard tanks from Germany and Denmark are due to arrive by 1 June, and the US has promised by autumn to deliver refurbished Abrams tanks.

Kostenko said some of the European tanks were old versions, prone to breaking down. Russia had many more – “around 10,000”, he estimated. Ukraine’s urgent need was for long-range artillery, capable of striking targets deep behind enemy lines. The existing US-supplied Himars system had a range of about 50 miles. Since its arrival last summer, the Russians had moved their headquarters and weapons dumps out of range, he said.

The Biden administration had refused to supply longer-range ATACMS rockets, which can be fitted to a Himars launcher, apparently concerned that they might be used to strike targets inside Russia. “I don’t know why,” Kostenko remarked. On Thursday, the UK’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, said Britain had supplied long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles to Ukraine. This is a significant boost to Kyiv and may prove transformational on the battlefield.

Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of Kherson’s regional military administration, said the Kremlin had abandoned plans to take more territory after its failure last year to seize Kyiv and its embarrassing retreat this week from the outskirts of Bakhmut, where Ukrainian forces advanced more than a mile. “The Russians are now trying to defend areas they already stole. They are not going forward. They are standing, and dying,” he said.

Prokudin said Ukraine had a good chance of fully liberating Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces, where locals supported Kyiv, and “pro-Russians” were very small in number. The same was true of Crimea which he said had not undergone the same intensive Russification as Donetsk and Luhansk, the two eastern cities in effect controlled by Moscow since 2014, when Crimea was annexed. These eastern areas would be harder to free, he said, but added: “We’ll get there.”",,Luke Harding,2023-05-12,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/12/ukraine-prepares-to-take-back-territory-from-russia-step-by-step-roman-kostenko,1422
98,theguardian.com,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 395 of the invasion,"At least 10 civilians were killed and 20 wounded from long-range Russian bombardments in several parts of Ukraine on Friday, officials said. The casualties included two people who died in heavy Russian shelling of the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province in northern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said.

The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A new report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”.

The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow was readying for a Ukrainian counteroffensive that “everyone knows” Kyiv is preparing for. Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Putin’s powerful security council, warned that Moscow was ready to use “absolutely any weapon” if Ukraine attempted to retake the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014.

Russian forces attacked northern and southern stretches of the front in eastern Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Friday. Ukrainian military reports described heavy fighting along a line running from Lyman to Kupiansk, as well as in the south at Avdiivka on the outskirts of the Russian-held city of Donetsk.

The US president, Joe Biden, has said he believed China has not sent arms to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. “I’ve been hearing now for the past three months China is going to provide significant weapons to Russia ... They haven’t yet,” he told a news conference on Friday. “Doesn’t mean they won’t, but they haven’t yet.”

Ukraine claimed Russian forces were “running out of steam” in Bakhmut and its commanders have started to raise the prospect of an unlikely turnaround in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city.

Three women were among at least five people killed after a Russian missile struck one of the “invincibility points” providing refuge and basic services for Ukrainian civilians in the eastern city of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region, local officials said. The Russians attacked overnight on Thursday with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, prosecutors said

Air force commanders from Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark have agreed to create a unified Nordic air defence aimed at countering the rising threat from Russia, they said. The intention is to be able to operate jointly based on already known ways of operating under Nato, according to statements by the four countries’ armed forces. The Danish air force commander, Major General Jan Dam, said: “Our combined fleet can be compared to a large European country.”

About 10,000 civilians, many of them elderly and with disabilities, are living in “very dire conditions” in and around Bakhmut, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Several thousand civilians are estimated to remain in the city itself and be “spending almost the entire days in intense shelling in the shelters”, the ICRC’s Umar Khan said.

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said the “friendship” between China and Russia has limits, and that Europe should welcome any attempts by Beijing to distance itself from Moscow’s war in Ukraine. He said China “has not crossed any red lines for us”, adding that Beijing’s proposals to end the war showed it did not want to fully align with Russia.

The bodies of 83 Ukrainian soldiers killed fighting in the war have been returned from the Russian side, a Ukrainian official said. Separately, Kyiv said it handed over an undisclosed number of seriously wounded Russian soldiers.

Seven Ukrainian children have been reunited with their families after being forcibly taken to Russian-occupied Crimea, the Kherson regional military administration said.

The security situation around the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv will have to improve before its ports can be included in a deal allowing the safe export of Ukrainian grain, a senior Ukrainian official has said. The deal was extended this month, but Kyiv and Moscow differ over how long the extension will last.",,,2023-03-25,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-395-of-the-invasion,671
99,theguardian.com,Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 429 of the invasion,"The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a nine-storey block of flats in Uman, central Ukraine , has risen to 19, including two 10-year-old children, the regional governor, Igor Taburets, and other local officials have said. The announcement brings the total number of people killed in the wave of pre-dawn strikes to at least 21. Russian missiles also hit a home in the central city of Dnipro, where the city’s mayor, Borys Filatov, said a young woman and a three-year-old child had been killed.

Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops, the country’s defence minister has said, and are, broadly speaking, ready. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for when the counteroffensive would start but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready. Kyiv has been preparing a counterattack for several months aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south.

Vladimir Putin on Friday said Russia needed to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Russia’s economy has faced multiple challenges this year, including a weaker rouble, lower energy revenues and further isolation as western countries continue to impose an array of sanctions over its war in Ukraine.

A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong. Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”.

A Ukrainian journalist, who formerly worked for the BBC, has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia invaded the country in February 2022. He later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked from 2007 to 2011 at the BBC’s Ukrainian service, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” and “heroic” reporter and news presenter.

The UK has signed a £1.9bn deal with Poland to provide the eastern European nation with a British-designed air defence system. Some 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with Common Anti-Air Modular Missiles (CAMMs) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where CAMMs are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Russia has informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which Russia controls, will be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. A small number of International Atomic Energy Agency officials are present at the ZNPP, which is operated by Ukrainian staff working under the orders of Russian forces and the Russian nuclear company Rosatom.

A UN committee said on Friday it was deeply concerned about human rights violations by Russian forces and private military companies in Ukraine, including enforced disappearances, torture, rape and extrajudicial executions, Reuters reports. In its findings on Russia, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Russian authorities to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed during the invasion of Ukraine.

Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but also means those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. Reuters reports that the decree, which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the four regions Russia has claimed and partially controls, sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there – or those holding passports issued by Russia-backed breakaway republics – can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status.

Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse cited Spanish media as saying the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine.

Reports were emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies. Reuters cites a military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and the news website RBC as saying Mizintsev, who orchestrated the siege of the devastated city of Mariupol last year, was no longer in the role he was appointed to last September.",,Joe Middleton,2023-04-28,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion,891
