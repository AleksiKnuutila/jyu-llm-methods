My husband and I ordered two burittos. One with sofrita and the other with steak. The gal gave us a 1/4 of a spoon of sofrita and said if I wanted more, we'd have to pay for double the sofrita. When asked about the sample size portion, we were told it was 2 ounces and that was the protein requirement. We had to double the steak for my husband too! Not going back to this location again.  If you need a children's size burrito then this is the spot for you!!!   \n",

I'm used to spending half the price and getting a bowl twice as big from traditional pho places. There's only one bowl size here, and it would be considered a small/regular at most pho places.\\n\\nThis place seems like half high-end pho restaurant, and half diner. Service here is so-so, especially for the small crowd at the time. As for the pho, the broth was very disappointing. Not only was it somewhat bland, but temperature-wise, it was lukewarm. Not only was I able to finish my pho quickly, but because it wasn't hot, it took a long time for the pieces of meat to cook in the broth.\\n\\nOverall, if you want something different in a casino, this is a good option. But if you want good pho, make the drive to Chinatown and get the good stuff.   \n",

Here it is.\\n\\nWe were excited to try this place because we'd heard about the patio seating overlooking a lake, romantic lighting, and even an outdoor fire pit.  \\n\\nBut as we were being seated, we noticed the restaurant was almost empty.  Not a good sign.  It took a while for a server to approach our table.  When we asked to see the prix fixe menu, he seemed annoyed.   We decided against ordering from the prix fixe menu anyway, because it was solely Irish food designed to commemorate St. Patrick's Day, even though we were there a week or so after the holiday.  It took another long while to actually place our food order.   I also asked for an ice tea refill, which never came.  This is not the kind of service you'd expect for a \\\"\"fine dining\\\"\" experience.\\n\\nAs for the food, after our salad course, we were presented with a complimentary amuse bouche which was a little bit of olive oil, cheese, and a cherry tomato, served stylishly in a shot glass (see pic).  This seemed like a promising way to start our meal.  My husband had the filet and he said it was good.  I had the pork chop and it was awful.  Most of it was grizzled fat, and when I could find a pocket of lean meat, it was dry and flavorless.  I'm usually not one to complain, but the meat was so tough, I had difficulty cutting it, even with a big steak knife.  I should have returned it, but I didn't want to make a scene in such a beautiful environment.  I regret that decision.\\n\\nYes, the patio setting is lovely, but given the poor service and sub-standard food, we won't be returning   \n",

I was just lazy so I popped in here since it's closer to my house than my regular place.\\n\\nI was seated right away so A+ for that.... but the guy that did my nails was a smoker and must have just had a smoking break because he was stinky :(  On top of that... his hands were less than pretty.  I get that when you work on nails w/ acrylic and a million different shades of nail polish that you might not have a fantastic manicure but putting on some lotion and filing down your nails would make me more comfortable.  If you know how to take care of you own hands then I'll have more confidence that you can take care of mine.\\n\\nThe last critique that I have (and this just may be me) but they had the television turned onto one of those Deadliest Catch type shows and while I wanted to relax and pamper myself I was also stuck watching a bunch of fish getting their heads chopped off.  Less than relaxing.\\n\\nI'll probably skip over this place next time I come looking for a manicure.   \n",

I came in to get the nachos that are so delicious and was upset with what they turned out to be. I normally order them with steak, they were out, and everything else on it. The person helping me was using very small portions. I had to ask him for more of almost everything as he was loading them up. I am not selfish with the portions I would just like them to at least cover the top portion of my nachos. I ended up having to take them out of the container they were in and mix them up myself. I got to where I needed to pay and the girl didn't seem to know what in the world she was doing. I had to tell her twice what I got and she still rang it in wrong. I will go back with hopefully a better experience.\\n\\n\\nJust a note.....\\nRubber gloves are supposed to help with cleanliness, when you are touching everything with your gloves, what is the point in wearing them.   \n",
              "172  It appears to be an okay restaurant, but nothing special and seemingly not worth the price.  I sat at the bar for my first visit and thankfully Nine On Nine has a good happy hour with half price food from the bar menu as well as discounted wine and drinks.  The wine list is pretty good and lots of choices by the glass so that's a positive.  The cocktails didn't look very exciting so I didn't try any cocktails.\\n\\nAs for food, thankfully I went for half price happy hour dishes because neither the mussels nor the risotto I ordered was would have been worth the full prices of $16 and $14, respectively.  Don't get me wrong, there were a huge number of mussels in the bowl, but they were overcooked and a bit stringy, some hadn't been cleaned properly and were grainy, and the sauce (which is one of my favorite parts of a good mussel dish) didn't add much flavor other than when it soaked into one of the 6 or 7 tiny little crouton-sized pieces of bread that were sprinkled on top of the dish.  The mushroom risotto was fine but nothing special - slightly too al dente and missing salt or something so it just didn't have much flavor.  At $8 and $7 per plate I've had a lot worse, but these dishes definitely weren't worth their full menu prices.  Oh, and the ceviche of the day - which I did not get - was tilapia.  I've rarely ever seen that before - nothing like a cheap, typically muddy tasting fish for a good ceviche...\\n\\nI may go back and order off the full menu because I can't argue with some nicely chosen wines by the glass for $6 during happy hour - and a lot of people seem to like the food here - but the next visit will confirm whether it's worth ever going back after that.  The prices aren't cheap so my expectations are high and food on my first visit didn't come close to meeting them.   \n",

After all, Pink's has been on the Food Network and all over the internet. \\n\\nThe reality, however, was far from great. The food is overpriced and mediocre in quality. The jalape\\u00f1os are overdone in order to really bring out the spiciness  - but all you get is lots of heat and very little flavor. The meat sauce for the chili dogs and fries is canned and seating is extremely limited (not a good thing when you are talking about 100 degree Vegas weather).\\n\\nIf you want to try it for the experience, go for it. If you decide to skip it - you wont miss a thing.  There are way better places on the strip.   \n",

They seated us quickly (with reservation). Nice interior atmosphere, romantic. Good rolls too. \\n\\nCons: My husband got food poisoning. Thankfully, we did not share much foods, but we have narrowed it down to either the salad or steak. 5 hours after leaving he was in the bathroom all night. Which is a big bummer considering it was his birthday dinner and I surprised him with this restaurant. \\nMy entree was a pork chop, and I ordered it from the yelp recommendations and server. I didn't care for it. It was flavored well but the dish seemed cheap. Pork chops are not a nice cut of meat, and it was served with a bean/rice and bacon dish. Bacon is a cop out for flavor. I should have ordered seomthing else because I was expecting so much more.\\nAlso, the service is slow. We were really waiting for our entree, 2nd course and even the check for sometime, he was beginning to get annoyed. We ordered everything in advance, so I really don't know what took so long between courses. \\nWe also were seated next to the kitchen's in/out door, which they covered with glass but still not a pretty view from many angles. I noticed several tables seated further away probably also had this view. Its a pet peeve of mine to be at a upscale restaurant and see the kitchen and wait staff in the back. \\nAlso, there is a very limited menu. It was fine with me, but if you find yourself with a picky eater, this could be trouble. \\n\\nWe will not be going back, mainly because of the food poisoning.   \n",

Of all the genre's of cuisine, it is by far the easiest to execute well, so when I go out for mexican I expect a certain level of quality to the food.  Needless to say I wasn't impressed by anything at Macayo's.  The chips and salsa were mediocre at best, and the main courses sadly followed suit.  I am oblivious as to how places like this have more than one location.  If you are truly looking for a great experience check out Gallo Blanco over in phoenix.  Definitely worth the extra drive.   \n",

Starters; Oysters great. Ribs mediocre, wedge salad good. Shrimp salty. Main course: salmon, the signature dish, highly recommended by the server, was weird- BBQ sauce, sausage, fried onions- not balanced, and again over salted. My husband would laugh because I like my food salted, but this was way too much. Sides: mushrooms, and Mac and cheese nothing special. The service is below average and very slow. Two stars is generous. Seriously disappointing. Emeril put his signature on a tourist trap.Honestly, pick a different restaurant.   \n",

We were both super excited to get a Greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening.  It was pretty disappointing, I am sad to say :(\\n\\nWe had to wait about 5 minutes at the counter to place our order and finally, I think one of the owners, came over to assist us in our order.  We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples to all the tables which was very thoughtful.  The gyro was nothing to write home about, the meat on the top of the pita was very very crispy, crunchy in fact which oddly enough, added a pleasant texture.  The sauce was standard and was just the right amount.  The rice was a STANDOUT....super fluffy but in need of a little more seasoning.  My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty, the meat was lean, moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap.  Fries were standard with a slight sprinkle of parmesan and parsley.\\n\\nDeco was a little weird...........a map of Manzanillo Mexico in a Greek place was a little weird not to mention the Asian/Chinese art on the tables.  Television was quite loud and obtrusive, maybe a little mood music would be a better choice at night.  The service was really slow, they have been open a couple weeks now so maybe they are still getting the feel for the layout.  It was super clean, a positive for me :)\\n\\nI may go back in at lunch time perhaps to try out another dish.  I am really hopeful that they are able to maintain and stay open as every other establishment in this corner has closed previously.   \n",

Don't get me wrong, there were a huge number of mussels in the bowl, but they were overcooked and a bit stringy, some hadn't been cleaned properly and were grainy, and the sauce (which is one of my favorite parts of a good mussel dish) didn't add much flavor other than when it soaked into one of the 6 or 7 tiny little crouton-sized pieces of bread that were sprinkled on top of the dish.  The mushroom risotto was fine but nothing special - slightly too al dente and missing salt or something so it just didn't have much flavor.  At $8 and $7 per plate I've had a lot worse, but these dishes definitely weren't worth their full menu prices.  Oh, and the ceviche of the day - which I did not get - was tilapia.  I've rarely ever seen that before - nothing like a cheap, typically muddy tasting fish for a good ceviche...\\n\\nI may go back and order off the full menu because I can't argue with some nicely chosen wines by the glass for $6 during happy hour - and a lot of people seem to like the food here - but the next visit will confirm whether it's worth ever going back after that.

That said, it's definitely worth giving a try.\\n\\nThe food quality was generally very good to great.  The scallops and salmon were both very good, as were the wings and pork belly appetizers.  The desserts were very good as well.  \\n\\nThe only thing we weren't in love with was the turkey sandwich.  The turkey itself was very poor and had a weird consistency - sort of like \\\"\"spam\\\"\" is to ham.  The place just opened though and we mentioned this to them so we'll give them a pass and a chance to fix it.\\n\\nAtmosphere is decent.  It's easily one of the top few places in Fort Mill in terms of straight food quality.  A nicer place in that sense, but with a more casual environment.\\n\\nI would like to see them have a few beers on tap.  The bar is decent but only offers bottles.\\n\\nAll in all though we were pleasantly surprised by our visit here.  The food was tasty and beats out most other options in Fort Mill.   \n",
              "267  Every once in awhile, you're lucky enough to come across a meal that you'll remember for the rest of your life. It's not necessarily because you would want to eat that meal again and again in the future. It's just that the meal was completely different from any previous meal you had ever eaten.  In the case of Au Pied de Cochon, I don't think I've ever eaten a more decadent, rich, fatty, and hearty meal in my life. \\n\\nYou'll notice a certain common theme based on the list of key ingredients in the dishes that my friends and I shared: foie gras, bacon, boudin, and flaky crust. Having visited Montreal in late December when the weather is beyond frigid and the wind beyond bitter, I understand the genius and madness behind APDC: their food warms/insulates your body with the fattiest parts of other animals. \\n\\nLet's begin with the cromesquis de foie gras, it's basically a small bite: 2 quarter-sized puff pastries with hot foie gras liquid in the center. Arguably, it was the best bite of the night. Decadent yet light and an amazing way to begin the meal. They come 2 to an order and among the 3 of us, we had 3 orders.\\n\\nThen there's the much hyped foie gras poutine. It will be possibly the richest, fattiest, most decadent food you will ever eat in your life. One word describes it best: damn. Damn, it's good. Fries covered in an addictive foie gras based gravy, topped with cheese curds and 2 sizable slabs of foie gras. It sounds like suicide but amazingly, it works. Plus you can sop up the leftover gravy with multiple refills of crusty bread. \\n\\nAt this point, our stomachs were feeling it but we trucked on and split the also-hyped duck in a can and the boudin tart. As others have said, the duck in a can, presentation-wise, really does match the hype. It was awesome just watching the server open the can and extract a huge piece of duck breast with bacon, cabbage, and carrots in an earthy sauce onto a plate of cauliflower puree. The duck was cooked perfectly and was tender and juicy, and the vegetables gave it some much-needed flavor and textural contrast.  The boudin tart was also a unique, over-the-top dish with the incredible, almost mineral-y flavor of the boudin and a flaky, buttery crust. However, at a certain point while eating these dishes, I crossed my threshold for excess. Perhaps it had something to do with the dishes naturally getting colder as the eating went on. But, once that threshold was crossed, I was DONE. I realized there was a limit to the madness. \\n\\nDespite this overload, the saying \\\"\"there's always room for dessert\\\"\" rang true. We went against our best judgment and split the chocolate pot de creme. Served in a jar with a thick chocolate mousse on the bottom, whipped cream in the middle and little crunchies on top, the chocolatey dessert was irrationally a welcome break from the onslaught of duck and pork we had undergone. It was a fitting way to end a meal that will give me dreams/nightmares through the rest of my life. \\n\\nFor those coming from out of town, I'd highly recommend making a reservation as we made one 3 weeks prior for a wednesday night and it was packed. Also, plan some sort of physical activity for the next morning/afternoon: you will need it.   \n",

My car was less than 3 weeks old (2012 Sonata!) when my front and rear bumper were practically ripped from my vehicle....\\n\\nNow, with my sob story out of the way, I turn the page to a happy place as i sincerely thank Harvil's for their service. \\n\\nWith not many reviews of this location, but a recommendation through State Farm, I was a little skeptical on whether or not to give this place a chance. I'm all for supporting small, local businesses, but when it comes to my vehicle (which is the NUMBER ONE thing i'm picky about) I was very scared to put my faith in them 100%. \\n\\nNevertheless, I made an appointment, and walked away with estimates that were remarkably fair! At the time I was waiting to hear from another insurance company on their decision of whether or not they were going to accept fault for the claim, so when i receive the estimate, I was fully expecting to have to pay out of pocket. When i saw the estimates I immediately was able to breathe easier--I would NOT need to borrow money from anyone to get my car fixed *yay!* (BTW--the insurance DID end up paying....)\\n\\nI was given a time frame of when my car would be ready and was called as soon as i could pick it up. I ran into a small issue, as i work over an hour away and I needed to pick up my car (and return a rental) by 5pm on a Friday evening...while having to fight rush hour traffic. I was concerned I would have to pay for the rental car for the rest of the weekend because they are closed, and that i wouldn't get my car until Monday....but they worked with me and stayed there/open until I was able to come and get it. I did make it there just a little after 5 mind you, but they were more than willing to do what they needed in order to help me. \\n\\nTim was such a nice man to work with and his team did an amazing job with they work they did on my car. I will absolutely go back if necessary (hoping to God i don't have to though) and will recommend anyone for their service. \\n\\nTHANK YOU HARVIL'S!   \n",

I spent 45 minutes waiting on fries, and another 10 waiting for my hot dog. But then once I got them, I really didn't mind... If they'd had better/faster service, this place would be a 5-star slam dunk.\\n\\nCame here for lunch with 4 other people from work, and we weren't in a hurry but we weren't out to spend 3 hours eating lunch. The place wasn't very busy, another party of 6 was there and some were already eating, and a party of 3 that was getting an order for takeout had just ordered and left to return later. We were the only people that needed helping, but unfortunately it took us 5 minutes of standing at the counter to get waited on, and ordering was a slight hassle since the guy at the register was a cook, and trying to make food while running the counter and answering the phone.\\n\\nThere were two guys working, and it seemed like they cooked exactly one thing at a time instead of many things at a time. When our food came to the table they came out of order from how we'd been in line and ordered them, and they came out one at a time. It was about 20 minutes from the first dish coming out (my fries, which I ordered second) to the last dish coming out (my buddy's hot dog, which he'd ordered last). The guy who ordered first got his food second-to-last. It doesn't make any sense...\\n\\nI got the Eurofries and an Angry Dog. The Angry Dog was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't even close. Do not fear the Angry Dog. That said, it was really really good. The Eurofries were also really good. The fries were very well cooked, the dog was very well cooked, the seasoning and flavors were awesome except for the jalape\\u00f1os on top of the angry dog. I've had some jalape\\u00f1os that really punch me in the face, but these had absolutely no flavor or heat at all. \\n\\nDon't take that to mean the Angry Dog wasn't good. I just skipped the jalape\\u00f1os and everything else it came with was great. I have not a single thing bad to say about the Eurofries. \\n\\nFrom a healthiness standpoint, this place isn't going to win any awards. I mean, it's a fried hot dog and fries covered in sauces. But the quality of the meats were pretty dang good, especially for the price. No gristle, tender, good flavor, very well cooked...\\n\\nI'll definitely be coming back here every now and then, when I am in the mood to not care about what I eat and just eat something delicious, and when I'm not in a hurry.   \n",

The server was very friendly and genuine, a breath of fresh air after a day of travel. I ordered the sweet potato stuffed with quinoa, spinach and other various goodies. The flavors together were amazing, I've tried re-creating it at home and just can't! My friend and I shared a simple brownie sundae which was tasty as well. They had a huge catering order going out that evening which didn't seem to affect our food order.   \n",

The food was good but not that memorable.  I remember the candy cart being very awesome but can't recall specifically any one dish that stood out.\\nThe atmosphere was very serious and formal which didn't really contribute to my enjoyment of the food that much.  I remember all around us people speaking to each other in low hushed tones as if we were in an art museum rather than a restaurant.  I feel that being in a setting where you must treat your meal with such reverence detracts from the food somehow; additionally service was coldly polite so that didn't help things.\\nIf you must, don't do the full menu, there were a lot of extras on the menu and its easy to get full before even the meat courses start.   \n",

But when I grew up there was an video arcade machine in the 7-11s. Less one star for no streetfighter arcade game.\\n\\nBesides that nothing crazy or new about 7-11s. They have drinks, snacks, and misc grocery stuff. I always thought that 7-11s were convenience stores without the gas station. Well I've been proven wrong about that now since there are 7-11 gas stations... Who would have thunk it!?   \n",

I'd looked online & saw they carried plus sizes, so I hesitantly gave it a try. \\n\\nI could not have been happier. Whole the selection in my size was limited, I did have an array of choices. I found a fantastic dress & paid much less than a new dress. The rental process was simple & I have four days to return it -- not one as a previous reviewer stated. I picked up Saturday morning & have to bring it back by Tuesday.  They also gave me the option of dropping the dress off at UPS. That may cost extra, but I live near the store, so I was willing to drop it back by. \\n\\nI will surely use them again. We are actually taking my daughter there to pick out a prom dress in a few days. Why pay hundreds for a dress she will never wear again?   \n",

I was very impressed because they even came out the same day!! Great job guys!   \n",

I just wanted a soda, he a had a chocolate shake in mind. I warned him not to get his hopes up- ALL fast food franchises are ALWAYS cleaning the shake machine after midnight, and sure enough, when we pulled up to the speaker and he asked if they still had shakes, The Voice (older female) said \\\"\"I don't think so, let me check\\\"\" and then, the inevitable \\\"\"No, the machine is down\\\"\"... but, WAIT FOR IT: \\\"\"I will make you one, though\\\"\". Wha wha wha WHAT?? My neck is still sore from the way my head snapped around. We drove around, thinking Ashton Kutcher would be at the window, laughing and pointing at our gullibility, but no, it was just this really nice lady, with a freshly made milkshake in her hand and a pleasant smile on her face. God love you, Carl's Jr Lady! These stars are for you!   \n",

Recently had a watch serviced by the manufacturer in preparation for making another new purchase soon and as part of that had some links in the old watch placed for cleaning.  Having now decided to hold onto the old watch and thus needing the aforementioned links removed I called Morgan Taylor up and was told they could do the work 'while I wait,' something two other dealers (including Tourneau in the Forum Shops) could not promise and when I showed up they did it for free, despite my offer to pay.  Apparently also offering custom work, repair, and jewelry ranging from the $50 up I'll definitely be back for minor repairs, though hopefully few and far between.   \n",

I don't know but the waitress understood me when I asked for Poutine Obelix (smoked meat), one of the 25 poutine variations on the menu. I prounounced it like we do in Manchester, NH (put-zin). Busy, funky restaurant in the Plateau neighborhood. The regular sized serving was more than enough for me. Dinner for two and a couple of beers came to around $30. A bit expensive for fries, gravy and meat, but it was tasty comfort food.   \n",

I was told that the burger served here was the best around, and being that half of the solid food i eat happens to be hamburger, i couldn't pass it up.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was great, open air to the casino but also secluded enough. The multicolored glass panels created for me a very relaxed feeling, always a benefit when enjoying good food.  Or was it thebeer. I dunno, plus one for having good micro brews!\\n\\nLet me just preface the review of the food with one sentence. The service rocked. Our waiter was polite, attentive, and on point. Even when he was away attending other parties another, equally skilled, waiter was there to make sure we were attended to. \\n\\nNow to the food. In an attempt to show how classy i can be, even at lunch on a Monday, i ordered the tuna tartar with crispy wantons. It came in a cylindrical presentation with a layer of fresh avocado on top. Just next to it was a streak of red sauce, the base of which had to be Sriracha or some similar red chili sauce.  This is probably the third or forth time i have had tartar, and it went down well. The tuna was tasty and had a nice soft texture. It went well with the avocado. \\n\\nIf you love burgers, this one will make you see god. It was perfectly cooked, moist and de-licious. It came with fresh pickled cucumbers, butter lettuce, and a sweet onion marmalade. I will be buried with a bottle of ketchup right next to me, but on this burger, it wasn't necessary. All the elements included worked together, unlike most time i eat a burger where half the stuff wilts next to my french fries. Which were also good, never doubt a Frenchmen's restaurants ability to bring the frites. \\n\\nGo there, eat a burger, smile.   \n",

Eight six ounce (?) cups are topped with half a scoop of ice cream and served on a marked tray with Coca Cola trivia. Between four of us, this was the perfect amount of this frothy delight to satisfy our sweet tooth. The advertised flavors are Original Coke, Sprite, Cherry Coke, Barq's Root Beer, Cream Soda, Mello Yello, Orange Fanta, Strawberry Fanta. When we got ours, the Cream Soda was replaced with Mr. Pibb Xtra. No big deal, just one of the friends was looking forward to that one above all else.\\n\\nI would have to say that all of the pop went well with the vanilla ice cream. Fanta and Mello Yello were some of the better ones that seemed unorthodox at first, but won us over.\\n\\nI would not mind giving the Soda From Around the World Tasting a try ($7), but they use to have a lemon seed fizzy drink that was very unappetizing. Will not risk that again.   \n",

It is by far the best deal on the strip! \\n\\nWhen we told our friends where we had decided to stay they were giving us a hard time saying that it was sketchy and lame, so we were a little worried that we had made the wrong decision. I am so glad we didn't change hotels! \\n\\nFirst of all the location is perfect! Within walking distance to almost everything and across from Bellagio and Caesar's palace. Our friends (the same ones who were giving us crap about staying at Bill's) stayed at Paris, they had a view of a parking garage, had to walk miles thru the hotel just to get to their room, and they paid twice as much!! Their room wasn't even that great! Needless to say they felt pretty stupid when they saw our room and our view of the strip and Bellagio fountains!! Ha!! They totally got ripped off!! Not to mention that we also had access to the pool at the Flamingo next door which was an awesome pool, so much fun! The pool at Paris was lame and full of screaming kids!\\n\\nThe rooms at Bill's are by no means fancy, but for the price and location they are pretty darn good! The casino was actually fun and loud and always seemed to have good music playing. The drink special were awesome, and after a long night of drinking, the steak and eggs were the best way to end the night/early morning! It was also nice that it is a smaller hotel, easy to get around and not get lost trying to find your room. Big Elvis was awesome too!!!\\n\\nOverall we had a great time at Bill's and we would definitely stay there again!   \n",

I brought my dachshund into their hospital after he was sent home with inconclusive results from Sonora Pet Hospital (DO NOT GO THERE!)  Charlie was experiencing extremely severe stomach cramps and was quickly deteriorating throughout the day.  I took him to the Sonoran Hospital on Cactus and they took blood work, xrays and of course did a physical exam and the vet there could not find anything wrong with him at all and basically told me to see how he was doing the next day.  Well, I knew he was just not improving, only worsening so I called the Alta Vista Pet Hospital and spoke with Sabastiana, who was very compassionate and amazingly helpful.  I rushed Charlie in because of his worsening condition and the very reasonable prices ($65 for a walk in vs $105 other places) and the extraordinary Dr. Foster immediately found a foreign object stuck in his intestine.  She quickly removed it with surgery, and thankfully Charlie is recovering wonderfully.  IF I did not bring my dog there he would have died overnight, the vet said.  I will be forever grateful and thankful to Alta Vista for saving my weenie's life!!!!   \n",

It was big enough for me to share with another person and there was a ton of bacon which, or witch certainly cast a spell on me.  If I would have eaten the whole, uh hole thing,  I might have gotten a stitch in my side while swimming in the lazy river after but like I said, I shared because I wasn't that hungry having eaten a nasty weinerschitzel chili dog thing earlier. \\nSo, the moral of the story is \\\"\"Don't drink those nasty $18 retarded drinks that come in a plastic hookah\\\"\"   \n",

Once I saw where we were staying and the reviews I wasn't happy at all. We had actually stayed at the hotel about 3 years ago and I knew all the reviews were spot on. The room wreaked of cigarette smoke and was very run down and gross. Nothing I could do though since we booked through Hotwire.\\n\\nHowever, I was very shocked when we checked in to learn that they were in the middle of remodeling all their rooms. we received one of the rooms that had been recently renovated and loved it! The nasty carpet is gone and replaced with a laminate hardwood. The kitchen and bathroom were very clean and updated. The bed was comfortable and very clean. Overall, I loved our stay and will definitely be staying with them again. Once they get all the rooms updated, this will be a great hotel. Oh and the horrible smell is gone, if I remember right, they are now a nonsmoking hotel. Our room had a faint paint smell to it but nothing that was unbearable. Give this place a chance and try requesting one of the remodeled rooms when you make your reservation.   \n",

The playboy bunny's are adorable and happy to take photos with those who ask. The gents working door and what not were super sweet. \\n\\nI didn't gamble at all but, but, when I go again I will plan to drink less so I can.   \n",

That said, it's definitely worth giving a try.\\n\\nThe food quality was generally very good to great.  The scallops and salmon were both very good, as were the wings and pork belly appetizers.  The desserts were very good as well.  \\n\\nThe only thing we weren't in love with was the turkey sandwich.  The turkey itself was very poor and had a weird consistency - sort of like \\\"\"spam\\\"\" is to ham.  The place just opened though and we mentioned this to them so we'll give them a pass and a chance to fix it.\\n\\nAtmosphere is decent.  It's easily one of the top few places in Fort Mill in terms of straight food quality.  A nicer place in that sense, but with a more casual environment.\\n\\nI would like to see them have a few beers on tap.

              "      <td>Every once in awhile, you're lucky enough to come across a meal that you'll remember for the rest of your life. It's not necessarily because you would want to eat that meal again and again in the future. It's just that the meal was completely different from any previous meal you had ever eaten.  In the case of Au Pied de Cochon, I don't think I've ever eaten a more decadent, rich, fatty, and hearty meal in my life. \\n\\nYou'll notice a certain common theme based on the list of key ingredients in the dishes that my friends and I shared: foie gras, bacon, boudin, and flaky crust. Having visited Montreal in late December when the weather is beyond frigid and the wind beyond bitter, I understand the genius and madness behind APDC: their food warms/insulates your body with the fattiest parts of other animals. \\n\\nLet's begin with the cromesquis de foie gras, it's basically a small bite: 2 quarter-sized puff pastries with hot foie gras liquid in the center. Arguably, it was the best bite of the night. Decadent yet light and an amazing way to begin the meal. They come 2 to an order and among the 3 of us, we had 3 orders.\\n\\nThen there's the much hyped foie gras poutine. It will be possibly the richest, fattiest, most decadent food you will ever eat in your life. One word describes it best: damn. Damn, it's good. Fries covered in an addictive foie gras based gravy, topped with cheese curds and 2 sizable slabs of foie gras. It sounds like suicide but amazingly, it works. Plus you can sop up the leftover gravy with multiple refills of crusty bread. \\n\\nAt this point, our stomachs were feeling it but we trucked on and split the also-hyped duck in a can and the boudin tart. As others have said, the duck in a can, presentation-wise, really does match the hype. It was awesome just watching the server open the can and extract a huge piece of duck breast with bacon, cabbage, and carrots in an earthy sauce onto a plate of cauliflower puree. The duck was cooked perfectly and was tender and juicy, and the vegetables gave it some much-needed flavor and textural contrast.  The boudin tart was also a unique, over-the-top dish with the incredible, almost mineral-y flavor of the boudin and a flaky, buttery crust. However, at a certain point while eating these dishes, I crossed my threshold for excess. Perhaps it had something to do with the dishes naturally getting colder as the eating went on. But, once that threshold was crossed, I was DONE. I realized there was a limit to the madness. \\n\\nDespite this overload, the saying \\\"\"there's always room for dessert\\\"\" rang true. We went against our best judgment and split the chocolate pot de creme. Served in a jar with a thick chocolate mousse on the bottom, whipped cream in the middle and little crunchies on top, the chocolatey dessert was irrationally a welcome break from the onslaught of duck and pork we had undergone. It was a fitting way to end a meal that will give me dreams/nightmares through the rest of my life. \\n\\nFor those coming from out of town, I'd highly recommend making a reservation as we made one 3 weeks prior for a wednesday night and it was packed. Also, plan some sort of physical activity for the next morning/afternoon: you will need it.</td>\n",

My car was less than 3 weeks old (2012 Sonata!) when my front and rear bumper were practically ripped from my vehicle....\\n\\nNow, with my sob story out of the way, I turn the page to a happy place as i sincerely thank Harvil's for their service. \\n\\nWith not many reviews of this location, but a recommendation through State Farm, I was a little skeptical on whether or not to give this place a chance. I'm all for supporting small, local businesses, but when it comes to my vehicle (which is the NUMBER ONE thing i'm picky about) I was very scared to put my faith in them 100%. \\n\\nNevertheless, I made an appointment, and walked away with estimates that were remarkably fair! At the time I was waiting to hear from another insurance company on their decision of whether or not they were going to accept fault for the claim, so when i receive the estimate, I was fully expecting to have to pay out of pocket. When i saw the estimates I immediately was able to breathe easier--I would NOT need to borrow money from anyone to get my car fixed *yay!* (BTW--the insurance DID end up paying....)\\n\\nI was given a time frame of when my car would be ready and was called as soon as i could pick it up. I ran into a small issue, as i work over an hour away and I needed to pick up my car (and return a rental) by 5pm on a Friday evening...while having to fight rush hour traffic. I was concerned I would have to pay for the rental car for the rest of the weekend because they are closed, and that i wouldn't get my car until Monday....but they worked with me and stayed there/open until I was able to come and get it. I did make it there just a little after 5 mind you, but they were more than willing to do what they needed in order to help me. \\n\\nTim was such a nice man to work with and his team did an amazing job with they work they did on my car. I will absolutely go back if necessary (hoping to God i don't have to though) and will recommend anyone for their service. \\n\\nTHANK YOU HARVIL'S!</td>\n",

But then once I got them, I really didn't mind... If they'd had better/faster service, this place would be a 5-star slam dunk.\\n\\nCame here for lunch with 4 other people from work, and we weren't in a hurry but we weren't out to spend 3 hours eating lunch. The place wasn't very busy, another party of 6 was there and some were already eating, and a party of 3 that was getting an order for takeout had just ordered and left to return later. We were the only people that needed helping, but unfortunately it took us 5 minutes of standing at the counter to get waited on, and ordering was a slight hassle since the guy at the register was a cook, and trying to make food while running the counter and answering the phone.\\n\\nThere were two guys working, and it seemed like they cooked exactly one thing at a time instead of many things at a time. When our food came to the table they came out of order from how we'd been in line and ordered them, and they came out one at a time. It was about 20 minutes from the first dish coming out (my fries, which I ordered second) to the last dish coming out (my buddy's hot dog, which he'd ordered last). The guy who ordered first got his food second-to-last. It doesn't make any sense...\\n\\nI got the Eurofries and an Angry Dog. The Angry Dog was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't even close. Do not fear the Angry Dog. That said, it was really really good. The Eurofries were also really good. The fries were very well cooked, the dog was very well cooked, the seasoning and flavors were awesome except for the jalape\\u00f1os on top of the angry dog. I've had some jalape\\u00f1os that really punch me in the face, but these had absolutely no flavor or heat at all. \\n\\nDon't take that to mean the Angry Dog wasn't good. I just skipped the jalape\\u00f1os and everything else it came with was great. I have not a single thing bad to say about the Eurofries. \\n\\nFrom a healthiness standpoint, this place isn't going to win any awards. I mean, it's a fried hot dog and fries covered in sauces. But the quality of the meats were pretty dang good, especially for the price. No gristle, tender, good flavor, very well cooked...\\n\\nI'll definitely be coming back here every now and then, when I am in the mood to not care about what I eat and just eat something delicious, and when I'm not in a hurry.</td>\n",

The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at different threshold settings. This visualization allows analysts to assess a model's performance comprehensively, as it reveals how well the model balances its ability to correctly identify positive cases while minimizing false positives. A perfect model would yield an ROC curve that hugs the top-left corner, indicating high sensitivity and low false positives."
