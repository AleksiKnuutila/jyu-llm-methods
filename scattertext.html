The colors of the car's innards remind you of maybe the New York subway system, but with less fecal matter (give it time)... and of course, with 99% less speed or usefulness.

I ordered the signature hammered hog sandwich with the macaroni and cheese.  The pork on the sandwich was dry and a little tough.  There are only 2 barbecue sauces to choose from and I wasn't particularly impressed with either. The sandwich had a ranch slaw that was OK and the bun was grilled. Unfortunately I had to disassemble the whole thing to put sauce on the meat and by the time I was done trying to reconstruct it, it was a soggy mess. The macaroni and cheese was home made but not especially good.

Unfortunately; I had a gas line bust on one of my dual tanks. It was a Saturday so I used my AAA road side assistance (12 year member) to have it towed to The Car Shop. With the great reviews and the AAA recommendations I did not hesitate to have the work completed on my 1987 V-10 Custom Deluxe. They completed the work in a timely fashion. After I pick up the vehicle I filled the tank with gas and it didn't work. I took my truck back and they reviewed their work and the manager informed me that the switch was malfunctioning. I asked if they had tested it after the \\\"\"repair\\\"\" work was complete. They said, \\\"\"No\\\"\". It is common practice to test something that has been fixed. I spoke with the manager and we had a disagreement about what was wrong with the truck. He refused to fix it and wanted to charge me an additional $200.00 to fix something I already paid him to fix ($326.00). Needless to say I took my truck back to my original mechanic and they solved the problem right away. Problem resulting in a kinked hose - the one they replace. The arrogance and dishonesty from the manager was nothing short of a disappointment. I understand the dynamics of the repair and was willing to work out our differences but this man insisted the malfunction was not caused by the work he had done.

My criteria is as follows for AYCE sushi joints: \\n\\nFish to Rice Ratio. (nigiri)\\n- This is the second most important factor to me. AYCE sushi joints will charge you for any left over rice, and because of this most consumers tend to fill up on rice and not the good stuff. The ratio at this restaurant is horrible, the protein of the nigiri sushi is supposed to smother the rice, and the nigiri is meant to be eaten in one bite. I'm a big guy and it took me two bites to eat the sushi mainly due to the fact that they use a huge guap of rice. They seriously expect you to eat it too. \\n\\nFish Quality. (nigiri)\\n- For AYCE sushi the fish quality is spot on. I would actually say its above average. \\n\\nRice Quality. (nigiri)\\n- Now this is pretty standard in the sushi community and is pretty hard to mess up. My rice in my nigiri was too warm, the rice is supposed to be room temperature or a little on the colder side. The warm rice interfered with the taste of the fish.\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n- For AYCE this place sucks donkey dick. Cuts of fish are average and in some cases above average, but it still is not enough to balance the gigantic portion of rice. The AYCE menu is weak, I've eaten at other $20 AYCE sushi joints and they have items like: Quail egg over tobiko, Uni (limited), Amaebi (limited), tuna tar tar (limited). \\n\\nPersonal Experience (which I'm sure is not an accurate review of the restaurant)\\n\\n- Water had a nasty taste to it, informed the waiter, waiter gave us 3 options: Bottled Water, Soda, Alchohol. We opted for soda, and we paid for soda. \\n\\n- Service was slow, one chef and one helper, california rolls pre made, sashimi platter pre made, A lot of items are pre made. \\n\\n- Ambiance was nice, the joint is really clean!", "Why would you go to this place? Chances are you drove by 50 good restaurants and buffets to get to it. Real medium food for the price. I understand the draw- crab legs, sushi etc. but this place is not good. It's old and dingy just like the Rio is starting to look. The seafood was not the correct temperature and looked like it had all been sitting awhile when we were there for prime time dinner on a Friday night. Just trying to save others the time and option of choosing a better meal. Sorry Rio but yuck!!", "Could be the best Ribs in Canada but I haven't had many good ribs in Canada. I find it awkward when I travel back home to Montreal with American friends and Montrealers will start pushing Bar-B-Barn on the them. From My experience Bar-B-Barn can't compare to even a mediocre U.S. Rib. I'm shocked that there are some positve Yank Yelper reviews.\\n\\nOne thing that really pisses me off about this place is the small serving of fries and sauce that comes with most meals.

Did what instructions said daily  but no use my bouquet was just getting worse. For $150 I think they should last up to a week!! Maybe the glass beads didn't let the stems breath idk or the way they cut them you could see the stems darkening where they cut or scraped them. see my pic!", "I still can't figure out why my friend picked this place, but since I hadn't been, I thought  what the hell.  I had driven by it before, heard about it and thought it would be another cool experience of Las Vegas.\\n\\nWell, it was a unique one.  The place was DEAD at 7 on a Friday...I mean NO ONE there but the bartender, a very drunk woman playing video poker at the bar and the two of us.  Oh wait...there was a security guard at the door for some reason, even though he didn't move the entire time we were there.\\n\\nThe place is much bigger than it looked, and the beer was cold which is always good.  The beer selections was not, but $2 each I didn't complain to much.  We had a few beers then it started to \\\"\"Hop\\\"\" as the bartender commented.  Yep...there was a whooping 8 people in the place when we left!\\n\\nIt was unique and I'm glad I can say I went...but don't see myself going back unless I'm tricked into it.", "If you're looking for authentic pizza, this is not the place. FUEL offers a variety of Strombolis, Calzones, and Pizza, but leaves much to be impressed. Everything's pretty costly (two Strombolis for $15?), so be sure to be ready to spend that money. If you're in need of drunk pizza at 2am once the bars closed, you're in luck. The food is warm and they offer a lot of options. However, if you're looking for authentic NYC pizza, stay away.", "Decided to try a different KFC. This one too was out of chicken at 6:45 pm. It was a 12 minute wait for grilled chicken and 7 minute wait on the corn. The squirrelly looking manager doesn't know how to run a business. He rudely came up to the cashier and told him to stop taking orders. He walked past him and said something smart to him again. Will not be coming back here. Learn how to run a business and fire the night time manager. How dare he talk like that to employees. I finally got my food 17 minutes later. They gave me coleslaw instead of the wedges i asked for which took another 5 minutes.", "Went to Rula on an ASU football game Friday.  I don't think they put an ounce of thought into their business levels or needs of their customers.  I get there and the front entrance is closed off and there is a sign that says to use another entrance.  The arrow pointed in one direction but the entrance was actually in the back so there's one fail for directing traffic.  I finally get to the back entrance and it's understandably busy.  The bar on the patio is swamped so I expected to wait a minute to put in a drink order.  I stood there for 5 minutes (timed) and it wasn't until a female friend of mine walked over (didn't wave or draw attention to herself, just simply walked up) that we were acknowledged and asked what we needed.  Coincidence?  Not sure and I don't care!  We get our drinks and when it was time for round 2, I waited 9, yes, 9 minutes to order.  Again, same friend walked up and viola, \\\"\"what can I get you guys?\\\"\".  The bartenders seemed friendly enough but they had ZERO sense of urgency and apparently had some fixation with the right side of the bar because they were helping existing and new customers over there while I waited.  One guy (older) who was bartending and was moving at a snail's pace.  This held up the other guys from pouring their drinks so to pass the time along, they were all joking around with each other instead of acknowledging their customers (yours truly) and letting us know it would be a minute.  Laughable.  Another couple were waiting and discussing how bad the service was as well.  They got so irritated they ordered their drinks, slammed them down and left.  If you're looking for a low key place to get a drink, I would only recommend this spot if it's dead slow or if every other bar on Mill is closed!  PASS!", "I found this place painfully disappointing. I have heard others praise it but it so boring. The food lacks imagination and complexity. When we arrived the mood lighting was so low that we could not see the menus- we actually had to hold them up to catch the light- we joked about it at the time but it was very annoying. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and found an abundance of beans and cheese accompanied by about 2 tsp of avocado and a dash of salsa. It was not in any way worth the money.  In addition, my friend ordered surf and turf and got 3 small shrimp and a small steak... I mean really the guy paid $20 for the meal, they could have at least given 5 measly shrimp. \\n\\nOn the positive side, the building is pretty and they do give you a dessert if it's your Birthday. \\n\\nI'm not usually very critical but this place needs an honest critique.

Otherwise, I don't understand what all the hype is about.\\n\\nThe appetizer squid and olive salad was quite good. I thought I can make better green salad, though. Both of our entrees were so terribly salty that I thought about sending them back to the kitchen, but instead, I just didn't bother finishing it and forced myself to wash down the portion that I ate with wine. \\n\\nThe dessert was nothing extraordinary. My pana cotta tasted good, but my ex's chocolate cake was as dry as a kitchen sponge. \\n\\nI've been to some of the most acclaimed restaurants in the country, and I'm sorry to say that Harvest is far away from making into the list.", "Stopped here today for lunch.  Ordered pizza by the slice.  1 hour later our pizza came, without an apology of the delay of the pizza.  It was not crowded at all at the restaurant.  A family came in after us, we received their bread sticks, they took it off our table and handed it to their table.  Is that even sanitary?  They also received their full pizza before we got ours.  \\n\\nPizza was greasy and tasted like jar sauce.  crust was good.", "I'll start by admitting that I'm not the target demographic. Also, I didn't see this place called Ladyland - It looked like it was called Electric Couture. Anyway, they were having some sort of yard sale complete with Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man and a cheap looking vinyl sign crookedly held up with rope. It looked out of place to a humorous degree.\\n\\nWe wandered over and browsed the tables a little bit. There were a bunch of clothes out, but none of it really looked like it was on sale. It was as though they thought more people weren't shopping there because they didn't want to go inside with the air conditioning. It was like a tacky bizarre ghetto yard sale for rich idiots with more money than taste or sense.\\n\\nOk - well, before I get all descriptive and shit - I'll just leave you with this which I hope will explain my low ranking of this store... The first item I picked up to look at was a pair of cheap unbranded knockoff Converse All Stars (likely from China) with skulls painted on them (with a rubber stamp) priced at $250.00.

It helps, I swear. It also helps to surround yourself with a large number of girls if you're a guy, so thank God we had that cleared. \\n\\nFirst things first: the girls in the bathtubs?

Laughable at best, extremely expensive (12 dollars for a shot?!), and small!\\n\\nThe music is your basic hip-hop-Top 40 mix, which tells me the club has yet to go super mainstream. There's more to music than Tupac's \\\"\"California Love\\\"\" or Kanye's rehash.  Tao would be a much cooler place if they mixed it up and threw in some electro.\\n\\nI will say, however, that the decor is something out of a movie. Over the top, ridiculously artificial, and a bit too overblown for my taste.

The used the excuse as a tactic to make more money knowing at that time people were not going to be able to leave and would not want to pay to get into another club. When I politely asked to speak to management, the manager explained to me that he made an executive decision. So I asked him for his business card as well as a note saying he cut off the open bar at 1:30 so I could request a refund. At no point did I demand drinks or act inappropriately. He refused to give me a card and instead called security to throw me out of the club. Security even grabbed me by the arm until I took out my phone and recorded the interaction.

We showed the waitress the bugs and the manager eventually only compensated the one plate (Could of done a better job, come on... these are bugs crawling in your food, a definite health violation).  Also who knows the bugs could have been in all of the food. The waitress seemed like this was a normal occurrence which makes me wonder how bad it really is. Half of the bugs from the plate escaped into the booths. So next time you go to this Denny's keep an eye out for little bugs in your food. The bugs were the size of a nail head.

A friend and I went into the restaurant a few days ago to see if they were open for lunch. We saw a young woman working at the podium and asked if they were open. She was on the phone, looked at us, and held up 5 fingers. Not being sure if that meant to wait just a minute, we stood there and waited. After maybe 3 minutes, she showed no intention of helping us or even getting off the phone. She wouldn't even look at us as I made it clear that we were looking for the website to see if they were open. She was on the phone still, now laughing at the conversation. It sounded like a personal call. I asked once again \\\"\"so you guys aren't open?\\\"\", and got completely ignored. So we left, not able to dine there since we weren't able to find out from them if or when they'd open. We could smell food cooking from outside, so we assumed they were open. After we left, we took our business to a nearby competing restaurant, and I had probably best steak I've ever had in my life there (Filetto Di Manzo Toscano at Brio Tuscan Grille). I recommend everyone try the steak there. The service is also far superior, as their employees aren't making personal phone calls and ignoring customers.  I would have liked to try Texas de Brazil, but honestly with such a bad first impression, it doesn't seem like it's worth it.\\n\\nThis happened on Tuesday, September 9th, around 12:35pm.

In order for boys to even be allow entry into Marquee, they were REQUIRED to have a 1:1 ratio. (Security was literally walking up to guy groups and kicking them out of line.) So our group of 20+ girls waited in line with the 16(?) boys so that they could get into the club. We waited for 3 hours. I'd say we should get mad props because we could have gone to the girls only line and gotten in right away.\\n\\nOnce we got inside, the club was SOOOO PACKED. UNBELIEVABLY packed. I felt like the entire club was as packed as the floor of a NKOTBSB concert. Marquee, how are you going to make me wait 3 hours to get into a club that I can't even dance around in?

The servers also seem not too inept with when it comes to being attentive or really serving at all.  I am sure there are good servers, but my experience was not so. \\n\\nMy friends came before me and ordered their food at the bar.  When we got a table they told the waiter that they were going to go tell the bar-- he said not too, that he would close out their tabs and transfer their orders to the table.  This was clearly not done as their orders sat at the bar for about 20 minutes before they were brought to the table.  This was only after asking repeatedly for their orders (since all of us were pretty much finished ordering).  He assured them again and again that the kitchen was working on it and they were just backed up.  Finally, the waiter brought the orders to the table and simply explained, 'yeah, they were sitting up at the bar.' No apologies.  Judging by the ice cold french fries-- the orders were sitting there for a while-- which seems a little unsanitary to me . . . \\n\\nSo in conclusion, Fitzgeralds is MEH.  Go somewhere else.  There are PLENTY of bars and restaurants in Uptown-- several serving up the same kinds of food and atmosphere as this place.

Two weeks later when it's finally \\\"\"ready\\\"\" I picked up our keys (which were the incorrect ones) and learned that we had no running water because they had cut it off due to doing a horrible job redoing our tub. On top of that, our heat didn't work. At all. For probably the first 3-4 weeks that we were here. In January. Luckily we have a fabulous maintenance man, Sharron, who went above & beyond what we expected and even left his personal space heater here for us. The \\\"\"upgrades\\\"\" are awful, apparently painting over super old cabinets is something to pay $200 extra for per month, and we went at least a month with a random kitchen drawer missing.

If not, stay away.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we booked it out of there and headed to calmer waters to the tune of a bar. Not making this mistake again.", "EDIT: Schnuck's has recently begun carrying a full line of Full Circle organic products at much lower prices than the organic items at Strawberry Fields.  For anyone who shops at SF because of their organic selections, give Schunck's a try.  I've been very impressed with the prices, selection, and quality of the Full Circle products.\\n\\nIf you're looking for more specialty items not likely to be found at Schnucks, try the Co-Op before you go to SF.  The Co-Op has many of the same items at much better prices.\\n***\\nThis was my favorite lunch place before their ill-conceived idea to close the cafe.  I used to be a regular who went in 2-3 times a week for lunch.  Since their wonderful cafe closed, I think I've been in twice, and the only reason is because I can't find unsweetened dried cherries anywhere else in town.  The minute I do, my Strawberry Fields days will be over.\\n\\nI think they made a huge mistake in closing the cafe, and their lame attempt to reincarnate a few cafe favorites at the tiny coffee counter is just not cutting it.  \\n\\nI do think that they could make a fortune if they put together a cookbook with their cafe recipes. They could even do product tie-ins and sell pre-packaged kits for some of the cafe items.  I'd pay good money for that, and, short of reopening the cafe, it's the one thing that could get me to start shopping here again.", "Seeing how crowded and their lack of urgency, I ordered an iced coffee since the brew is usually already ready. Waited 16 minutes for an iced coffee and saw the woman pull the ready brew out if the fridge and add ice.

This is one small business I will no longer support. I'll go back to Paradise Bakery for now on.", "i remember coming here after a night of clubbing at Rumjungle at the Mandalay bay. So that was probably about 4 in the morning. Service was okay, not the best.

I had a menu in mind and emailed it over. I was told that the chef did not feel comfortable doing it. It was a pretty typical menu, filet and fish with sides, etc and a Chinese food station (typical chinese food nothing crazy). strange, but whatever.  I then asked for menus to look at and the coordinator sent it to me saying that the menus are not extensive and have been this way for the past 8 years. thats a great selling point...not. i tried to set up an appointment to see the place but the coordinator seemed to never be available. \\n\\nthe coordinator didnt seem to care if i booked there or not. not a feeling you should let your client's feel. there are so many places out there, you should be fighting for business. or maybe even care a little bit more.\\n\\na friend of mine, her brother got married there a year ago. she ended up doing  A LOT. she had to lay the linens down which is the venue's responsibility (their linens). they would not put centerpieces down or help with lighting some candles. my friend and her husband was there hours before the wedding setting up tables, chairs and linens and stayed after the wedding tearing it down. \\n\\nfrom what i can tell in photos, it does look beautiful, but the service i have had so far stinks. if i can getting this kind of experience now, what kind am i getting day of my wedding or the days leading up to it?", "Terrible service.  They were not busy.  Took 10 min to get a beer.  20 min to get appetizer and 40 min from ordering to getting food.  Also waited most of that 40 min without anything to drink.

The staff is neutral-unfriendly, far from superior customer service. I've come here appx four times since they opened and have had to wait for the side I wanted each time. This time, I get here at 11, when the store is supposed to open, its been 20 minutes, all the sides are not out, and the steamed rice and mixed veggies are not prepared. To be honest, I will probably still come here because its close and there aren't a lot of other restaraunts in walking distance, but I'm ashamed.", "Do not waste your time. I hate to be negative however...horrible service. The waiter did not get our order correct but we could not tell him because he did not come back to our table until we were done eating. When told of the mistake he said, \\\"\"Oh you ate it.\\\"\" We said yes we did after not seeing you we decided to eat it.  We were looking for $1.50 off for not giving us the steak. That was all.

Check in was fast and all good, the room was dusty, you could see dust all over the tv and it looked like it hasn't been cleaned in a while.  Now the bathtub was leaking, called the operator to complain and they just told me that they were fully booked.  Ok, so we went out and when we came back, we went straight to bed...  Man !  We were on the eighth floor and I guess the windows are not very well insulated, you could hear all the sirens and police activities from the strip.. and to top it all, the heater/ac was extremely loud, every time it stoped it sounded like some wires or metal pieces were loose. I just couldn't sleep.    \\n\\nI wasn't impressed with the Tropicana Las Vegas at all !   Decorations were nice  on the hallway and the ceilings of the rooms...

On top of that they forgot my friend's order and after 15 minutes came back to ask what he ordered again. Very poor.... High priced", "So disappointing! Went to the tasting menu they had back around x-mas and it was bad! The chef started the meal announcing to everyone that they had changed the menu three times before preparing it for that night, believe me it showed! It just seemed so amateur and thrown together at the last minute.  Could've been so much better.  I had been in before and had some of their regular menu items, this just really assured that I will not be back.", "Eeeek!! Here's the deal. I've known about DW Bistro for a LONG time now and have been dying to come on a date night, but never got around to it. I constantly see the reviews in my Yelp feed because I live so close-by, so I was really excited to finally try it last Saturday. My husband and I went with my sister-in-law before the Xtreme thing, because we had to have a sophisticated dinner prior to blending in with Las Vegas's most obnoxious crowd at Desert Breeze Park. \\n\\nOur server may have been the tastiest part of the meal (that was piggish, I know, but he was seriously HOT) and so friendly. It seems like the tables he was serving were all regulars, several of them with women. I bet they all ask to be seated in his section for some eye candy. MOVING ON! We started off with the jerk calamari. When they brought it over to us, we were really surprised because it was a pile of black, wet, calamari. It was calamari drenched in their jerk sauce which ended up being way too salty, and soggy. The squid inside however, was high quality, not chewy, and tender. I just wish it wasn't in that sauce. Sadly, this was a recommended appetizer. \\n\\nFor entrees, we went with more appetizers. We ordered the flautas, turkey sliders, and chicken curry soup. The flautas were tasty, but sadly not tastier than ones that I had at a hole in the wall Mexican take-out place in California. The turkey sliders that everyone RAVES about were so underwhelming! My SIL took a photo and put it on IG, and she had 15+ comments talking about how much they love this thing. I found pieces of the chutney to be bitter (orange peel possibly?) and the burger itself to be tasteless and dry. I just didn't understand the hype of this thing. It came with no veggies either which I found disturbing. It was just a brioche bun, turkey, and chutney. \\n\\nLastly, the soup that everyone on Yelp talks about was a nice sized soup loaded with chicken and veggies. However, I found the seasoning to be on the strong side. I loved the consistency, which must have used a lot of coconut milk to make it so creamy. Perhaps it was an off-night, but the food was not up to my expectations. Things were over-seasoned and I wouldn't order any of these things again. I really really want to come back (to spy on the hot waiter) and try their brunch because that seems to be where the real magic happens! The inside is beautiful, the patio looks perfect for a Spring day, and the environment lively to make a small or large party feel comfortable.", "Cool decor and slide show with excellent pictures of Sammy Hagar.  Unfortunately, this is where it ends.\\n\\nOrdered the burger melt and a draft.  Beer was fine, burger lacked tremendously.  Biggest shocker was the bill - $10.59 for a draft?  I thought it was an error but it wasn't.\\n\\nIf you don't expect much, then you'll be okay.", "I guess my mistake is that I ate at Lobby's in the evening when the owner wasn't there.\\n\\nThe young lady working the counter was sweet and was trying her best, but missed getting the order correct. Two burgers were ordered with cheese and bacon. Unfortnately the secret sause was added on to the burgers. We just wiped the sauce off but what an inconvenience. My burger was missing the bacon and a little under cooked. Meh, I've tasted better. The chicken sandwich sucked according to my wife. So that put a downer on the whole meal and a real silent car drive over to Chick Fil A to get a replacement for the uneaten chicken sandwich.", "Honestly, I've been here before and I really enjoyed it the first time; but this last time....how do you keep running out of fried chicken?  Ahh...when I did have the opportunity to taste the fried chicken, it was like home cooking.  So crunchy, just the right amount of seasoning...truly grubb'n!  Now, I wonder if that was fluke, since the katsu was ok and my husband's tapsilog did not hit the spot.  \\n\\nThe saving grace was the Adobo fried rice omelet.  sorry, that's what's up with this spot.", "Wow, avoid this place like the plague. I received the worst basic mani pedi I have ever had. I just got home and couldn't wait to post a review, it was that bad. \\n\\nI will be attending a black tie gala tomorrow and I will have to have my color redone because my manicure color is so uneven. I didn't complain because the lighting in the place was horrible and I had difficulty assessing the quality of her work. They had limited selection of colors, most of which were Essie (I like Essie, though, but that wasn't the issue). As another reviewer pointed out, they had more colors for sale then they had available for choosing for a service. \\n\\nThe place is stark and they have limited supplies and tools. no dryers that I noticed or was offered. no frills and the service was minimal. I was given a pedicure(neither good nor bad) and then was told to get up and go to a bar for my manicure. I wasn't helped or assisted in any way over to the counter and it was just so strange. The bar used for the manicure was just a counter and they laid out a ratty wash cloth and set down a cereal-like bowl filled with a warm, orange liquid for soaking one hand while the other hand was being worked on. I don't know how to explain it other than to say it was so awkward. She told me, at one point to take off my watch after which she put a blob of pink lotion on my arm for the massage portion of the manicure but didn't tell me to remove my bracelets or rings. Hahaha, it was just so strange! After finishing she mumbled something to me and then said thank you and disappeared. I was left at the counter I guess to wait for my nails to dry. Their were employee sitting across from me chatting and giggling and it was just the oddest environment that I waited briefly, and decided i wanted to leave. I messed up one of my nails, didn't ask for them to fix it and just left. I won't be returning.", "Worst service ever from a server named, Lisa. You'd think at a $30 buffet, some form of liquid would be brought to the table in under a half hour. I've been waiting for my second orange juice for 45 minutes. This is a joke.

The wait staff is hit or miss, and does feel a little like a strip club.  Dog friendly patio, which is great.  Not a bad place for afternoon summer drinks.", "First, let me start by saying:\\nPROS:\\n- The staff was very lovely and friendly, and took the time to welcome you and cover the menu \\n- The food was very good: the Maple Glazed Rotisserie Chicken was very tender, moist, plentiful and did show the maple glaze, with a rice that had just the right amount of heat from the poblanos. And the beignets, while not as great as the ones in New Orleans, were a nice touch, with caramel and Nutella dips. \\n\\nCONS:\\n- The decor, as many have said, is, well, interesting - a kind of 80s chic diner, with lots of metal.  Good music on the background does help keep the place fun.\\n- The fountain sodas DO NOT come with free refill (although I can't remember for the life of me seeing a note about that either on their website or on the menu, so it caught me by surprise a little)\\n\\nWORST PART OF ALL:\\nThe main reason, though, for my low rating is that, despite what Yelp says, this place should not be considered wheelchair accessible.  \\n\\nIf anyone who's in a wheelchair and could not move out of it came to the restaurant, they'd not be able to sit anywhere.  \\n\\nWhile the entrance to the restaurant is (awkwardly) accessible, none of the tables are for someone who couldn't move out of their wheelchair.\\n\\nThe place is divided into (two, I believe) levels.  The first floor has high bar stools, and only 5 booths - which themselves are elevated.  The second floor has many more tables and booths but, being up a few steps - becomes completely unaccessible.\\n\\nSo I showed up to dinner at 8:05 p.m.  All five booths on the bottom floor were taken.  So while there were plenty of seats upstairs, I had to wait for one of the five booths downstairs to open.  And maybe I was just unlucky or whatnot, but it took 45 minutes for one to vacate.  (Many people were finishing their dinners, paying, and still staying to chit chat.)\\n\\nI can't, of course, blame the guests for sticking around in their booths once they're done eating, to chat a little more (I'm sure I've done the same).  Nor can I require the restaurant to keep a booth open at all times for disabled patrons.\\n\\nBut it'd have been nice to have had a heads-up that the restaurant is just slightly accessible, instead of what Yelp seems to say, and that this situation could happen.  By the time I realized what was going on - how long the wait would be - it was too late to consider going elsewhere.  And it just became a bad situation for everyone.\\n\\nSo the low stars on this, once more, is for the \\\"\"false advertising\\\"\" that this restaurant is truly accessible.  It's somewhat accessible, only to patrons with some mobility.  And, even then, it can lead to bad situations like the one I just experienced today.\\n\\nThe great food and pleasant staff made up for some of it.

I had to tell the men what to do when they were going to leave after doing a poor job on the trees and not cleaning out any of the overgrown bushes. They still were not thorough, so I called and they sent another crew (some were the same guys, but the lead guy this time spoke English). They were not thorough this time, either. The lead guy told me after about 20 minutes that he did not have any more time and repeatedly said the tangerine tree was \\\"\"not his problem.\\\"\" i could call hus bows, he said, if I wanted to discuss that. The men employed do not have any real landscape training. They cut my citrus trees up (raised the canopy, which is not what you want to do with citrus) the first time, instead of just cleaning out old dead branches. They refused to finish cleaning out the one tree when they returned, and I had to point out that those who prune trees commonly cut suckers, showing them what the suckers are and where they needed cut. I then left a voice message reporting what the lead fellow had said about the one tree not being his problem (mind you, I reminded him and the lady on the phone that I would never have agreed to the huge sum of $250 if the tree cleanup had been expressly included--my grass was not overgrown, I have few bushes, etc.) and I said I no longer wanted to enter into the maintenance agreement. This was 5 days ago. I never heard anything back. Do not use this company. They leave business cards on doors and then demand to start with a full, way overpriced cleanup before they'll do maintenance, with unskilled and unmotivated laborers.

Big mistake this year.  Just married I thought it would be a great present for my new husband..maybe even a new tradition.  Well, we will never go again. The \\\"\"new\\\"\" show was awful.  The show did not represent Christmas it actually felt like a bunch of guys with long hair got together and decided to have a jam session.   The storyline was based on letters found in an attic..boring to say the least especially after a narrator would talk about each letter and then some one would come out and sing about what the narrator just said.   There were several songs that we could not even understand due to what sounded like screaming combined with screeching..ugh.  The light show was good but with the show being so bad at that point the lights were unimpressive.  Eighty percent of our section left after the first hour of torture.

The broth - the most important part of ramen - was like water (not enough taste to even call it bland). The kimchi was meh, the noodles weren't cooked all the way, and the bowl wasn't piping hot when served. The best part of this tasteless dish was the two strips of pork belly. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the curry rice with shrimp that came with a salad and miso soup.

They were busy, as usual, but...\\n\\nWe waited 8+ minutes for the server to ask if we wanted drinks because she was at the table next to us the entire time talking about her personal life with some customers.

When we wanted a refill, my husband (after a 15 min wait with no one coming to our table) got up and went to the bartender for refills.  She said she wasn't allowed to (direct quote).  The hummus came out as a large, we asked for a small.  If you have been here before, you know it usually takes 5-8 minutes for hummus.  We waited closer to 20 and then another 15 for our meal of a beef gyro and the spicy chicken wrap.  My beef gyro came out and it was disgusting.  The meat was crusty and dry.  I couldn't eat it even though I was starving.  The server brought the manager over to talk to us.  We should have taken that opportunity to let her in on everything, but we were too hungry and frustrated at this point and potentially not thinking clearly.  She comped the humus (was not necessary, for the record) and my meal  and then disappeared.  \\n\\nAnother 20 minutes goes by, my hubby is done eating, we still don't have refills and just want to leave.

While our fries were delivered in about 15 minutes, the remainder of our lunch took 50+ minutes to be delivered. Then, unfortunately, our order was wrong. We got cheese smothered, grilled chicken, instead of smoked chicken. The pulled pork was cold, almost like it had been pulled from the cooler and not completely warmed. Ribs, brisket, pulled chicken were good. I like my St. Louis style ribs to be a bit more juicy, these were good, but I personally would like a bit less trimming of the fat. Sides were good except for ranch style beans, which seemed days old. \\n\\nThe server did credit our bill $6 for the cold pulled pork and also didn't charge us for our drinks. \\n \\nOverall, poor first impression, but enough \\\"\"possibilities\\\"\" to make a return visit probable.", "Went with a group for work.

After reading favorable reviews on one-star hotels and motels, I decided to stay here at the Crestwood Suites right off of Las Vegas Boulevard, just a few minutes south from the strip.  While being able to get good night's rest on my one-night stay, the room and its facilities have their fair share of pros and cons.\\n\\nOn the positive side, the place has a very nice price point, basic amenities and friendly customer service.

The room has all of the basic amenities, like shampoo, soap, iron and iron board, etc.  There's even a stove, refrigerator, cabinets and sink.  And also for a local hotel to have a good caliber of customer service, concern and interaction, at least that brought a lot of ease in my mind.\\n\\nHowever, I believe all those pluses don't cover up the two drawbacks of this place.  First off is the presence of the remnant secondhand cigarette smoke in the hallway and my room, which is on the first floor wing.  On top of hotel patrons, I personally couldn't believe how maids could make a living cleaning the rooms with this \\\"\"stench\\\"\" of a smell present.

Also, the room sofa has that small, yet disgusting, dry white stain sort of similar to Monica Lewinsky's \\\"\"blue dress.\\\"\"\\n\\nDespite these findings, the hotel is okay to stay in.

Apart from that, get your shit together, Luxor.\\n\\nWe did \\\"\"pre-check-in\\\"\" at 12 pm and were told that we'd be texted our room number.  That never happened.  I had to call the front desk and get my room number manually, which caused us to have to walk around aimlessly and unnecessarily for hours in the 100 degree desert heat.  Yeah, there's early check in, but they charge an extortionate fee of $20 for that privilege.  FYI, my friends checked in at 2pm without having to pay a fee.  Meanwhile, we were waiting for our text that would never arrive.\\n\\nThe $20 food and drink credit advertised on Expedia is a scam.  It's given to everyone and doesn't work anywhere you'd actually want to eat (the buffet, the pyramid cafe).  \\n\\nAs for checkout, I'm actually not sure if I'm checked out yet.  I tried using the link emailed to me, but the website was down.  When I called the number, I got the hotel's main line.  What a joke. I finally was able to navigate the menus to the express checkout option, which tells you to leave your name and number with a promise to send you confirmation later by email or US MAIL!!!  I'm still waiting for that confirmation.\\n\\nWhat a terrible experience.  I won't be back, and I certainly won't recommend Luxor to anyone.  Shell out the extra $20 and stay at MGM.", "Tourist trap in downtown Scottsdale.  Beau and I were in for an awesome pizza experience.  What we actually got was: \\n\\n1. An antipasto that competed only with Costco tasters.  Haven't seen an antipasto so sparse  - with a few red peppers from the jar - in the Phoenix area. \\n\\n2.

We ate at the Mad Onion for dinner on Saturday because when we checked into the hotel on Friday we received a 50% off coupon for this restaurant.  And let me tell you, for the half-off price we paid, this was not bad. But if we had paid full price we would have felt disappointed. \\n\\nIt has long been a point of sadness for me that the whole food-service world has transition to an on-the-side mentality. When I order a salad with dressing, I want the dressing tossed in with the greens, not in a little plastic cup.  Well this restaurant takes \\\"\"on-the-side\\\"\" to a whole new level.   Everything that can come on the side does, including the butter and fixins for baked potatoes.  I requested butter, bacon and cheddar cheese.  All three came on the side. So I dumped them all on the potato and asked them to heat the potato up until the cheese melted, which they did do but their initial response was \\\"\"we don't do that\\\"\".\\n\\nThis restaurant has the \\\"\"feel\\\"\" of a romantic dinner destination but because of their \\\"\"cafeteria-service\\\"\" mentality, it will never be more than mediocre.  \\n\\nAs for the food itself, my steak was tender and tasty and cooked properly. The baked potato was a little under-cooked but acceptable after I had the re-heat it with toppings. The fish n chips was also good enough to not be disappointed but was certainly not something you would rave about and look forward to on your next trip to Vegas.\\n\\n Like the hotel this restaurant sits in, this Mad Onion is not bad, but is certainly not very good.

Lebanon area.  I know this is not the same location but how different can the food be for this kind of chain (although at the time of getting food there I did not realize this was a chain).  We got food to go so I can't comment on the service.  I don't recall exactly the names of things we got but I know that there was lentil soup (completely underwhelming, over-spiced with oregano??? but otherwise bland), grape leaf wraps (bland and boring), and two pitas...one with lamb the other a combo.  My husband's combo pita wrap was alright, nothing to write home about though.  My lamb wrap was good enough to eat when there were no other options but not flavorful enough for fond memories of a meal.  Basically, other no-so super Lebanese eateries could wipe the floor with Aladdin's food.  I will never go back and would not recommend unless you are desperate and want to avoid other questionable places like Ruby Tuesday, TGIF, etc or nasty fast food.", "Is there such thing as zero stars here?

I just witnessed a guy kick out an old lady who was searching for transportation to attend a family funeral.  Since greyhound didn't had have the itinerary she needed, she sat there for a second to check her phone for possible other tickets.  He kicked her out ASAP.  The bus was an hour late departing.

This place has continued it's downward spiral.  It hasn't improved one bit since my last review.  It's actually gotten worse.  It's dirty, smoky, and the people who hang out here are sketchy.

The food was ok, I had the pretzel crusted schnitzel, mashed potatoes, red cabbage and spaetzle. It was a little bland and had a lot of grease!

They RUINED my birthday dinner!\\n\\nSix of us went because my uncle and I wanted to combine our birthday dinners. We had a table right up front and had terrible service from the start.

Luckily, we were in the room at the time and able to move expensive dresses and place solo cups strategically around the room.

Luckily it's rather convenient to get in and out of, but the prices are always more expensive than the other gas stations around. I guess paying an arm and a leg ain't too bad, right? Otherwise, it's not too shabby. \\n\\nHowever, I must comment on their air filling stations. One time my husband had to fill up our tires and there was only one employee working. The employee got the air to go and halfway through the air stopped. My husband went back inside and had to get them to turn it on again. Well, it didn't turn on. He went back in and they turned it on. Well, it didn't turn on - again. So he waited until the people next to him finished and he had to use their working air pump.

I endured a four night stay ending on July 3, 2011.  I booked the room online because the place is located right across the Strip from Caesar's and the room was relatively cheap. Here is what happened: (a) Upon check in, I was told told that I would not be staying in the actual hotel itself, but in the \\\"\"Capri Building\\\"\" located out back.  The Capri Building is the former Flamingo Capri Motel.  Just like any motel, you enter your room from an outside walk way (not from inside an enclosed hallway).  The other side of the walk way is a multi-story parking garage which is also the only view from the room. The shower was dirty.  Trash from a prior guest was under one of the beds.  One morning I woke up to find a HUGE (but deceased) cockroach in the middle of the carpet.  When I asked the front desk why ahd been placed in the Motel- and was not told about ti ahead of time- the response was \\\"\"well, you booked the room at a cheap rate\\\"\", and that I could stay in the actual hotel if I paid an \\\"\"upgrade fee\\\"\".  It was the victim of  a \\\"\"bait and switch\\\"\" that- in my opinion- borders on fraud.  (b) Unlike every other decent hotel, there is no Wi-Fi unless (of course) you pay another \\\"\"upgrade fee\\\"\".   Since I was spending the vast majority of my time in Vegas at a Conference (during the day) and out (at night), I sucked it up, figuring that I would only be sleeping there.  When I left, I felt dirty and with a bad case of the heebie-jeebies.  SO AGAIN- DO NOT STAY AT THIS DUMP!!!!!!!!!!", "Okay before i start this let me say that I AM glad that gameworks is back.  After nearly 3 years i really really....REALLY missed having it around.\\n\\nNow let me begin...\\n\\nFirst off, this place was a bigger letdown than i could've ever imagined. There couldn't possibly be any more than 45 arcade games on the game floor. The space that could be used to fit more game machines is currently taken up by over-optimistic restaurant space, unused party/banquet rooms and fancy looking walls. As it is at any gameworks a nice percentage of games were broken....but the difference between this gameworks and the others is that there's not much else to choose from....remember there's not even 50 machines on the floor which leads to my next complaint....a 2-3 person line to play literally any game on the floor. I'm not one to complain about waiting his turn, but this is a first for me at a gameworks. Arcade favorites like sonic the fighters, afterburner climax, marvel vs. Capcom, mortal kombat, street fighter, need for speed, f1 Ferrari challenge, and many many others are all MISSING from the roster. They used to be at the gameworks on the strip....i just don't understand why they wouldn't be here. The ticket/prize games are usually separated at most gameworks locations. Since this one is soooo tiny, they all just blend together. The prize redemption area is soooo small. I was tripping over small children and a couple of large, buff, angry dudes. Very uncomfortable...i never even got to choose my prize. More tickets for next time i suppose... Oh, and gamer beware. Many games will deduct points and the game will never acknowledge that you payed. Luckily the managers were able to see the cards swipe history and refund the card. in comparison to any other gameworks in the country....This game floor gets an F. \\n\\nThe e-sports room is passable....literally...you can pass right by it and not even notice it's there. Its a decent price to rent an xbox and tv but honestly the game roster is small. I'm not sure if you can bring your own or not. Theres a total of 4 stations with televisions. Imho they should have at least 7 or 8 but that's just my two cents. They have a 60pc lan party...which is 40 less than what was advertised last year. Which reminds me...they told us on the gameworks facebook and website that there would be a laser tag arena.....which...there is none. Very disappointing. The e-sports will definitely bring in revenue. It just needs more games and console/tv stations. The e-sport section gets a C.\\n\\nThe bowling ally and pool table area is nice. And it has its own bar which is cool since you don't have to leave to goto the game floor for a drink. You rent your shoes at the door. The alley lanes are very narrow compare to say...the station casinos. They're basically miniature bowling lanes....i haven't played on the lanes yet so its not really fair for me to review it. Id say a B just because it exists.\\n\\nLastly, the overall service and restaurant. I didn't eat at the restaurant yet...and i don't believe i ever will. Allow me to explain. I asked the bartender at the bowling center for a glass of water. He immediately tells me itll be \\\"\"a while\\\"\" before he can serve me the water. Which is fine....note that he had a group of 3 people to serve before me and as soon as he was done serving them...\\\"\"a while\\\"\" never came for me. No biggie. I guess good service is reserved for paying bar patrons. After spending 100 on points (which is ridiculous. I've never spent more than 40 bucks at any gameworks and i usually get hours of entertainment!) you'd think you would be treated half as decently as a hole in the wall bar. Later on i noticed i was hungry and i wanted something light, so i grabbed some wetzels pretzels which isn't far from gameworks.....BIG MISTAKE. I was just about halfway through my pretzel and walking back into gameworks when i was met with the most absurd statement: \\\"\"we don't allow outside food. Sorry.\\\"\" excuse me? I just spent how much money.....to play broken games?! I'm sure you wont mind if i finish my pretzel while i walk through your precious, oversized restaurant past your pitiful, undersized gamefloor, and get in my car. Service gets a D. \\n\\nWorst gameworks experience I've ever had. I have been going to various gameworks locations since i was 9 years old. I'm 26 now. I've never seen anything like this. It's as if they only care about making money. I wish sega never sold gameworks to espn. I hope this helps them make better decisions in the future and fall back to their former glory! Long live gameworks!\\n\\n  i give them six months to add more games before i write them off my hangout spots list.", "Ugh.  I went here because I wanted more service than the big box stores.  I brought a picture of my space and described what I wanted to the nth degree. Because they didn't have what I wanted in the showroom she sent me  links to products.  I was willing to spend more than the products she sent me.  The salesperson spent about 5 minutes on the task.  So I order it, and come home to  find a completely different tub (yes my contractor went ahead and installed. It even though it made no sense for the space).  Will never shop here again.", "We ate here a month ago on a Saturday night with my daughter and had an great time at the sushi bar eating and talking to the chefs. Tonight (after the hostess took phone calls while people were waiting) she told us children can't sit at the sushi bar on the weekends, so we left. Honestly, it seemed like a lie so she could send us to a table. It's upsetting because the food is good. But after being treated the way we were I'll never go back - with or without my daughter.", "Wow, what a major disappointment. I was so very excited about the prospects of having a decent BBQ joint near my house but alas it is not meant to be. \\nIn all fairness, the smoked chicken is spot on...

The fried pickles are suuuuuper greasy and the sides are just boring, but this is mainly about the brisket.\\nOn the first occasion, half of it was hot and the othe part was cold (obviously due to Chef Mike Rowave in the kitchen)  and it was soooooo tough I couldn't eat it. That brisket needed to be smoked at least another 5-6 hours to become the tender, juicy, falling apart in your mouth cut of meat that it should've been instead of this... this... sad, sad, sad excuse... I'm sorry cow, your death was in vain.\\nThe second occasion (yes, I decided to give them a second chance. Being from Texas, I love me my BBQ) was just as bad. I ordered the 1/2 lb of brisket and received a box of meat that looked like industrial sized rubber bands drenched in BBQ sauce. Once again the meat was sooooooo tough I couldn't eat it. Who is cooking this stuff?? Where are they getting these cows from to make this brisket, Kryptonia? Are you sure this isn't rhinoceros meat? \\nOn the third occasion.... Yeah right! \\\"\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...

And, now that I read that Verizon donates millions of our dollars to political special interests (which don't have OUR best interests at heart), it just keeps nailing the coffin shut for me. Yes, other big name mobile communications companies use their huge profits for political influence, but almost everything about the way Verizon does business, and fails in its service approach puts them at the bottom of the list behind AT&T , T-Mobile, etc. These companies are dominating our lives because they know, or figure upon the fact that we can't do without our mobile devices.

We felt like she didn't want to be there and do her job. Also, although there were not that many people the wait for our sushi (all raw, no cooking required) took a long time.

And for local places in my community, I will often say nothing if I don't have anything nice to say. But this experience was so thoroughly terrible I'm making an exception. A friend visiting from out of state was thrilled we had a Hungry Howie's in our town as this was her favorite pizza chain back east. Since we had not had a chance to try it yet, we gave it a go. First we tried ordering on the web site but it does not allow you to select a flavor for the crust - that seemed odd considering how much they promote this and rely on it to differentiate themselves from all the other pizza joints in town. OK, so we tried calling our order in. We had seen the specials on the web site, but when we asked for it on the phone, a teenage-sounding guy told us they didn't have that promotion and it would cost roughly double the advertised price. At this point I started getting annoyed, but I kept calm and ordered on, after all, our friend loves this place, maybe the food will redeem it. Since we were already out and about, we declined delivery and went in to get it. Imagine my surprise when we saw the front of the building was plastered with large advertisements exactly matching what we saw online. There were also posters and stands inside the restaurant showing these same deals. Really?! How could this guy NOT know the specials they offer? Does he come in through the back door every day? Does he never look left when he answers the phone? I probably should have said something, but at this point it was worth the extra money to not prolong any interaction with this person. I paid and left. At home we realized they never offered us a choice of dipping sauces for the bread sticks and that the pizza did not have the flavored crust we ordered. The bread sticks were burnt and tough. We tried to eat a couple but ended up throwing them away, which if you know me is atypical - I will eat terrible food rather than waste it, but this was beyond edible. The pizza was cooked to perfection, but the cheap ingredients and \\\"\"canned\\\"\" tasting sauce put it below average. Our friend assured us she has never had this experience at the other stores she has been to, that even the web site is better for other stores, and that we just have a bad one. Until this location brings its customer service and product quality up to the standards the chain apparently sets for its other locations, there is no chance we will be returning.", "This place used to be good. I'd been here at least six times before, without a complaint.... Then the service went to the dogs. The last time my three friends and I went was after a free show in the Quartier des Spectacles-- the place was packed, but we managed to snag a table that had just been vacated by a group of six on the terrace. The slightly frazzled barmaid approached us, greeted us in French, started taking our order and promptly detected we were English (though all bilingual, and responding to her in French, without a second thought).... \\n\\nAnd which point her attitude went from acceptable to horrifying. She rudely told us that we were far too many for the table because she 'could not pass' (bear in mind that this terrace is un-navigatable on any given night *and* we were four at a table just vacated by six). We civilly tried to come to some sort of understanding (IE- reshuffling ourselves to allow her a wider lane)...  But she would not be swayed and continued to speak to us in the same unacceptable manner. It got to the point that she called the manager over to have us thrown out of the bar (for being 'unruly'-- the manager would not allow us an explanation). If I had to hazard a guess, it's because we were anglophone. I truly can't think of any other reason for that sort of treatment or the Jekyll and Hyde act.\\n\\nI, nor my friends have never been rude to service people in our lives.

We've done it all - come early, get on a guest list, bribe - and each time we get a new bad experience with the bouncers. One incident, we were early in line, on the guest list and even spoke with the manager. I was wearing a button down short sleeve shirt and dress shoes. The bouncers let us wait in line for an hour, then when we were finally getting in, he took me out of line and said I wasn't up to code. My really good friend asked to speak to the manager, and they eventually let us in, but that was absurd. When I actually went inside, I was better dressed than half the people there!\\n\\nSecond, the bouncers are tricky when you get in inside. When they think you are drunk, they pretend they will give you water or give you air. Little do you know that they are actually escorting you out of the club. I definitely understand that there is a liability, but they separate you from your group and we lost a couple of people and never realized it until hours later. On top of that, I had one friend who definitely drank too much, and I was there to pick her up, but they would not allow me to. They sent her in an ambulance, and when I got to the hospital, the doctors said she wasn't even that drunk. Apparently the security at Tao are doctors and can judge when a friend can go on their own. \\n\\nFinally, the drinks are ridiculously priced, the place is way too crowded and the pictures of the Dalai Lama in on the walls are just absurd. \\n\\nNow we know the dj at Tao so we never have to wait in line or pay cover; yet we refuse to go there because of the terrible experiences.", "So sad...this place keeps getting worst every time.

The second, we showed up at 8:30 and were told that they were closed to prepare for tomorrow. Their stated hours are 9 pm close. I am so disappointed because we love this place.

The guy at the sushi bar took my order since I sat there, but another guy gave me my plate and utensils. They forgot to bring out the miso soup included in my meal, and when I asked about it later the bowl they brought out was lukewarm and not very tasty. It had seaweed and tofu, but no flavor and a strange consistency. \\n\\nThe ginger included with the sushi had a strange taste to me. I eat a lot of sushi, and this ginger was the artificially pink kind (which usually means mass produced). It had a strange taste which I could only associate with cheap alcohol. I understood why some of my friends don't like ginger if this is the stuff you try your first time. \\n\\nThe chirashi bowl I got was sort of small, but acceptable for the price. The one thing that makes me never want to come back is on the back of a piece of albacore the fish was turning GREEN... Now I've never seen anyone present a piece of fish to me that was already turning green.  I can't understand how as a chef you could miss that before putting it on the plate. Then have the audacity to hide it by putting that side facing the other way. I worry about what about the other pieces that I didn't turn around (that piece was probably on the end). \\n\\nEven more, the guy taking away my plate didn't notice that I had otherwise finished my plate but left that single green piece there for him to see. Doesn't that seem a little strange that someone would finish their meal but leave a single untouched piece of fish on a plate separate from what it was presented on? \\n\\nHonestly, the sushi rice was decent and I've had worse before.

SERIOUSLY. This guy had no idea what he was saying!!! He tried to sound extremely educated in food once I told him I was a huge fan of Nobu and that I had all his cookbooks and loved them all.

Don't try to play fancy foreign word games with me like I have no clue what you're saying. I flashed my best smile everytime he came to word vomit. He had good intentions, but it was borderline offensive that he tried to add in japanese words as if we didn't know what they meant.\\n\\nPROs: the staff is very attentive, very quick to remove finished plates so that the next course can be served. We never had to ask for a refill of water because of how attentive the wait staff was. The food was good, albiet pretentious... (I would never ever pay $30 for five paper-thin slices of hamachi with little slivers of jalapeno and overly acidic ponzu again), The menu was innovative, modern, and divided into clear categories to help you order a little bit of every category. The wait staff is very helpful with describing dishes, recommending dishes, and answering questions you have about the menu.\\n\\nCONs: again, extremely frou frou Japnese food. The price is not reflective of the quality of food. $40 for a tiny amount of risotto served in a fancy big plate that looks like a bowl... PLEASE. The black cod was not fresh-- it seemed like the miso was attemting to cover up the slightly old taste of the black cod... The ceviche hurt my masseters. I probably made the ugliest little puckerface from the acid in the ceviche $35 tiny bowl of ceviche. I'm fine with paying good money for good food, but honestly, Nobu was a let down.

We waited over an hour before calling it quits.  I started waiting inside the restaurant where I heard two large parties come in saying they had reservations, only to have the hostess tell them they had no record of it.  I overheard another frustrated woman say she had called ahead twice and was told they didn't do reservations, but that the wait was minimal.  When I looked in the restaurant, there were empty tables, clean and unseated.  45 minutes in the hostess apologized for the wait, said the kitchen was backed up and that it would just be a few more minutes.  We waited another 30 and left.  I was extremely disappointed.  Our time was wasted, the kitchen was clearly unprepared for the day and the front of the house staff looked overwhelmed.  I would anticipate weekend brunch to be a big draw at this place, but the cafe was so understaffed it makes me question whether it's worth going at all.

She told me that my room was not read6y yet come back about 11:00 AM. So when I return at 11:00 AM another desk clerk made sure I felt stupid for even asking if my room was ready, she also told me to come back about 12:30 PM. When I returned at 1:00 PM I was told that no room yet, come back about 3:00 PM, in the meantime others in my group checked in before us with the same rooms, our reservation was made 6 months ago. I came back at 3:30 PM; the desk clerk told me that it would be at least 6:00 PM to get a room. I then asked her to cancel my reservation that I would stay at another hotel, I called Holiday inn which offered me a room at the same rate and aid it is ready now. Since the desk clerk hear this she to me that my room is ready, 1 bed King, She took my card and started the check-in. When she told me that it was 1 bed I showed her the reservation was for a 2 double beds, she said that she had the wrong room. So she then had my room ready for me after waiting 8 hours.

I went to the reservation desk and complained.  We teach our kids they have to wait in line. It is common manners.  I was told the adults were out of town guests.  I would have to talk to the manager.  I spoke with the manager.  I explained that we teach our kids manners.  He told me essentially -- too bad these adults HAD to get through.  In the end, I was reprimanded by the manager for being rude because HE cut in line.  We never ate after waiting over an hour an a half.  Not only was this man condescending, he was mean and exemplified the epitome of incivility.", "Spent 6 days in Vegas over Xmas and one of our stops was Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. Got in a block long line that went rather fast. When I got inside, the disappointment started. This Pawn Shop is very small, TV makes it look bigger. Does not look like the show in some ways. Most of the items were in jewelry cases but not very much large items except for a few motorcycles. I challenge anybody to dispute this fact, about 30% of this shop was souvenirs. Frankly I expected to see tee shirts and some other souvenirs but not 30% of the shop. If you buy an item and a souvenir, you have to go to two different places to pay. Was told by an employee, that the Gang basically only comes in when taping, except for the old man. This is your typical case of show business going to your head. It looks like only about 40% of the people leaving bought anything. These guys for now are celebrities but you know what they say, what goes up, must come down. There are slot machines themed for the show. Seedy part of town also. They have a little area in the parking lot to buy snacks. Actually, there is an Antique Store across the street I enjoyed more. Just telling the facts.", "The food was not memorable but, getting food poisoning was.\\n\\nI ordered for five people and three out of five got uber sick.\\n\\nThe one thing we all had in common was the chicken.\\n\\nIf I didn't get food poisoning it would be three stars.", "Never again. The food was decent, but way overpriced for what it was. The crab cakes were cold. The chateau briand was cold. The vegetables were soggy and cold. \\nBut wait....there's more! The service was probably the worst that I have ever received in my life. It was slow and the female older server that did the table-side service needed a serious attitude adjustment. She was just plain rude, and was a complete wench when we asked a question about the menu. Isn't that your job?!?! \\n\\nSave your money - there are much nicer steakhouses to go. Stick to Gibby's, even the Keg is better. Hell, I think I would gotten better service at La Belle Province.", "It is with heavy heart I report that Lucille's, brand new to Phoenix, does not live up to its hype. \\n\\nFor shame this place could boast such fine decor, beautiful menus, and pleasant hospitable staff and then char the short ribs to the bone, inedible. If it wasn't for the thick sliced, juicy, fried green tomato appetizer I'd call the place a total bust. The flaky warm biscuits were nice with the honeyed sweet butter, but I know Bisquick when I taste it and I'm sure I've made these before at home. We had high hopes ordering up some blackened catfish, baby back ribs, beef brisket, chicken halves, greens, cheesy grits, garlic mashed potatoes, and a kids meal for the little one with fresh watermelon. First round was the wonderful mason jar drinks, Strawberry lemonade was sweet, fresh and thirst quenching, our muddy waters made with sweet tea and porch lemonade were good enough for three refills a piece. You'll understand however that the refills just had to keep comin' when I explain how the main course turned out.\\n\\nFirst they served up the catfish. I could hardly see the fillet behind the nearly three cups of potatoes. When I did taste it I realized this wasn't a blackened catfish this was a water filled thin sliced sponge someone left in the charcoal pile. No wonder it was hidden by the taters. Unfortunately, they were a mass of stickiness with dried chives. I didn't find a hint of butter, or garlic for that matter. My partner is Irish through and through and was dismayed. We didn't even bother putting black pepper on them or finishing them at all. I was excited to try the cheesy grits though. My first fork pulled out a warm melting bite and so I offered some to the little one, with some greens to broaden her Northern palate. The greens were fine, but lacking in the advertised apple-wood smoked bacon. It was more like a chicken bouillon broth. She opted not to have more of either. When I went to have more grits the mixture had cooled and was more of a 4th grade science project than a good feeling.\\n\\nThen came the meat platter. The chickens looked delectable and I quickly separated the meats from the bone. The dark meats were juicy, but the skin slipped off in a greasy way. The white meat was far too dry for my taste, but fortunately there were three bottled sauces we could mix together to dredge it through. Of course I believe that in a good BBQ the meat can stand on its own and you shouldn't have to dredge it in sauce to enjoy it. The brisket stood on its own. In fact it probably stood all by its lonesome out on a counter for an hour before it reached our table. Maybe cooking it in a bag instead of a dehydrator would have been a smarter method. Then came the hope of the evening, the lump of coal left to taste was apparently five baby back ribs. I had to saw them apart with a knife to free them from the creosote. The limited meat was not even worth trying to eat despite the three table sauces expertly blended to perfection waiting nearby. We tossed it back on the plate with the bones in disgust.\\n\\nMy daughter couldn't determine if her fries were fries or potato chips or onion straws, she decided she didn't really want them. The macaroni and cheese side was a small serving of elbow macaroni which seemed buttered lightly. Her standard is no name instant, the kind you used to buy 5 for a dollar and she was wondering where the cheese was. If I hadn't allowed the poor thing to eat the rest of the biscuits she would have gone home hungry. I will never understand how you can serve a watermelon that isn't juicy. The fruit is 90% water, but hers was an anemic example with seeds. For sure, the place had some fine appetizers and the desserts looked absolutely divine, but we were done before we even got to them and the check was already too high to consider salvaging the meal with a one pound apple pie slice. I cringed when they dropped off a comment card, but in the end I did the right thing and filled it out fair. When I want a great BBQ I think I'll be sticking to BobbyQ's where the St. Louis ribs are rubbed right and then bathed in a sauce you can't stop lickin' and where they send you home with beignets even if you don't order any, courtesy of the house.", "This is quite possibly the worst Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas.  No, it is the worst.\\n\\nI am still pissed off 3 days later.  Funny thing is they didn't do anything wrong in particular - I just get pissed spending money on crappy food!\\n\\nThe menu had Limited menu choices - in other words the top ten Americanized Chinese dishes and that is it.\\n\\nI ordered a garlic chicken.

First of all if you are a hotel on the strip in Vegas, YOU HAVE TO HAVE BELL MEN!!!!! We drove up to Excalibur and the valet asks us if we would like help with our bags, we of course say yes, who wants to drag their luggage through a huge casino.  I asked the Valet how long it would take to get our bags to the room, he says \\\"\"not long, check in go to the baggage desk and they will send them right up\\\"\". We check in, go to baggage desk and the lady at the desk informs us the Casino is NO LONGER ALLOWED TO TAKE BAGS TO THE ROOM! I through a fit and she continues to tell me it is a new policy. Then after throwing an even bigger fit, she says it will be an hour and a half to get our bags. So I say fine bring them on the cart and I will wheel the cart myself, she says that is is casino policy she can not allow us to use the cart. I then tell her we will leave and demand our money back, so she has a bell man walk with us to our room with the cart full of luggage.  I find out from the Bell Man or as I call the non-bell man what was going on. He said they fired 48 Bell Man to save money and are going to fire the rest. Excalibur Hotel, are you kidding me?

(That's what Vegas is about, right?) It was rated 4.5 stars, and was supposed to be a good place to grab breakfast. (I figured there should be a better 24-hour breakfast spot on the strip, considering it's Vegas and the place is all about gambling/partying into the wee hours of the morning. I was hoping that's what this was going to be.) Man oh man, was I disappointed!\\n\\nGoing to the address on that \\\"\"Buffet of Buffets\\\"\" listing actually brought us to Flavors. So, I'm rating Flavors, and I'm going to go ahead and forgive that my expectations of finding a decent breakfast at 4pm might've been a little unrealistic. (Hey, I still think that'd be an attractive destination for a lot of people. A 24-hour version of San Jose's Bill's Cafe (https://www.yelp.com/biz/bills-cafe-san-jose) would knock the socks off of folks seeking a late breakfast on the strip.)\\n\\nHere's what I found at Flavors. (Granted, it was 4pm on a Thursday. You may get better results at a busier time, but it wasn't an interesting enough place for me to bother giving it a second shot.)\\n* Waited 6 to 8 minutes to be seated -- place was not busy and no one in front of us in line. Could've seated ourselves...\\n* Lots of the food was way under temp. I'd say just about everything I tried except the soup were lukewarm and probably a food poisoning incident waiting to happen.\\n* Cheese ravioli -- might've been good if not cold.\\n* Penne pasta with alfredo sauce -- might've been good if not cold.\\n* Italian sausage and kielbasa were OK but lukewarm. Would've been tasty if it were hot. But nothing special here.\\n* Egg drop soup -- the base was unimpressive and did not seem very authentic, but they absolutely sank the ship by putting veggies in it that gave me the impression of Veg-All.\\n* Sushi/seafood I didn't dare touch after finding how poor a state the hot dishes were in.\\n* Fruit was OK but not a good selection (all they had was honeydew and grapefruit wedges).\\n* Every type of bread I could find was stale/hard/dried out like it'd been sitting out too long. (The corn bread and dinner rolls both had this problem.)\\n* Coffee was acceptable and, thankfully, nice and hot.\\n* Had some vanilla ice cream for dessert. Had to ask the attendant behind the counter to scoop it, but that was OK, and she was very nice. Unfortunately the ice cream was the one part of my meal I really enjoyed.\\n\\nOverall, the food not being maintained at sufficient temperature just killed this place for me. The price and service didn't do anything to redeem it. I personally wouldn't risk giving this place a second chance.", "I can only talk about the CASINO here, but from my impression of that I don't know that I'll ever experience the hotel by choice.  (Maybe due to the price or demands from friends who want to see the slanted windows in the main building, but never without significant prodding.)  The casino's fine, but there's an overall worn feeling.  It's also overly dark, feels much smaller than it is, and over the years has seen significantly increasing clutter with the massive additions to the atrium level.  I will say that the hotel gets some amazing exhibits and staff is very friendly.  But for now it'll mostly remain for me a brief stop to see what exhibits are there on my walk to or from Mandalay Bay.", "Just moved in here the other day and so far I haven't been pleased. I walked into my apartment and it REEKED of cigarettes. I'm not a smoker so I was not happy about it. I also went into the closet and was shocked to see two whole patches of carpet were missing. One was very small, but the other was pretty large. the management didn't want to repair it at first, then when they did repair it, it was with a completely different carpet. So now I have a smelly apartment with patches of different carpet and am paying just as much as other people who don't have these problems. The manager told me it wasn't a big deal because the patch is in the carpet and since I didn't pay for platinum I should expect to have bad carpeting. I'm sorry, but you should not have to deal with holes and patched up carpeting. I would be charged for that if I left the carpet in that state during a move out so it should be replaced for me if I move in and it is in that state. \\n\\nAnother problem is my bathroom. The tub has chips on the bottom and the shower head sprays everywhere when turned on. Also my bedroom door was installed incorrectly and doesn't close.

Our server seemed to be trying but it looked like he was overwhelmed. I ran out of my beverage several times and had to wait for a refill.\\n\\nI had a salad and my wife and I shared some meatballs. The salad wasn't the best, but it was OK. My wife and I both enjoyed the meatballs and sauce. Again, not the best, but pretty tasty. We tried one of their milkshakes and it was really good. I think that is the reason to go to the Meatball Spot. As I said, the food was OK. But, when you put just OK food with really bad service and then you get the bill. OUCH. I would not go back again because of those combined factors. But, I will be going back to get\\na milkshake.", "Fucked up my order. Told me they would write me up in the book so I can get compensated with my correct order. Drove 15 miles there today to find out I wasn't in the book!

That said - here's my review of your Otto Enoteca:\\n\\nWe started with the Gnocco Frito,  Eggplant Caponata, and Grilled Radiccio salad with smoked mozzarella.  The apps were okay - certainly not bad - but nothing special.  (also some drinks and wine which were just fine)\\n\\nThen we had two pizzas.  The Margarita DOC pizza and the Pancetta/Goat cheese pizza.  The Margarita DOC was truly disgusting.  The thin crust was tasteless and soggy.  The tomato sauce was as if someone had taken campbell's cream of tomato and slapped in on cardboard.  Then there was a dab of mozzarella.  Overall a tasteless, soggy, bizarre tasting mess.  C'mon Mario - please don't tell me you actually think this is good?   The other pancetta/goat cheese pizza had a little more flavor but still mediocre at best.  (btw: note to restaurant - those breadstick packets you put on the table are old/expired/have a funky chemical aftertaste).\\n\\nThe setting in St. Mark's square \\\"\"a la Venice\\\"\" is charming and romantic.  Really a lovely setting - and reminds me of my trip there many years ago.  The service is\\neager, but weirdly clumsy - like they  are trying too hard to let you know that this is a serious dining experience - overly explaining every little thing - and educating you on every ingredient if you ask a question about the menu - which is nice but just too much.  They also push certain dishes or desserts - but they go on forever when you really just want to cut them off and let them know you hate Pumpkin so no need to do five minutes on the\\\"\" deconstructed pumpkin cheesecake in a jar\\\"\".  Just sayin....   Somehow - we spent close to $200 on this meal - a lot given what it was.\\n\\nI had read the mixed reviews on yelp - including one that mentioned the Campbell's tomato soup tasting pizza - but I figured they were probably just being bitchy - and the location worked for us as we were going to see a show at the Venetian.  But the mixed reviews are accurate - and we will not be returning to Otto anytime soon.  Mario - still a fan - Joe, still not a fan.", "3.5 star rating, 2.5 star accomodations, 1 star guests.\\n\\nPros: good location (Scottsdale), showers immediately hot, nice smelling complimentary soaps.\\n\\nCons: paper thin walls, smoke smell in the \\\"\"non smoking\\\"\" rooms, cheap bedsheets that felt like plastic, high 4 inch door step that catches feet, overabundance of loud guests, cloudy/dirty water in the pools, so much chlorine in the pools that it burns your eyes immediately, FREEZING water in the \\\"\"hot tub\\\"\", very large cleaning carts blocking the sidewalks at all hours of the day and night, minimum utensils in kitchen, cleaning personnell who enter immediately after a light tap on the door.....\\n\\nAnd the everwhelming impression that I had been ripped off for staying here, that it does not dererve a 3.5 star rating at all.

The soups were incredibly diluted and watery.  The potstickers were tiny but didn't taste awful.  The Mongolian beef was the worst I have ever had.  It was rubbery, full of watered down sauce and tasted old and cheap.  The general tso's chicken was okay, but lacked sauce so it all stuck together and was overly chewy.  It was a rainy day around rush hour but we live not far away and it took over an hour to deliver the food.  Really unfortunate.  We will not be re-ordering from Fortune Cookies.", "The girl in the window every time I go is terrible!! Tried to charge me twice while I was waiting then finally asked what I ordered again (iced coffee) then I watch her make my drink and it was literally ALL cream and no coffee. And she's made it this way every time despite me saying light on the cream from the beginning. Absolutely no customer service here. Not like you'd get at Starbucks, I might just pay the extra for my coffee", "My experience is not based on my dining, I am writing just at the attitude I was given when I called to inquire about the place. While browsing on the net, I came across this restaurant that advertised on the uniqueness of the menu/ concept.  Being a 40 mile drive from my place, I called to inquire more about the whole concept they were selling.....And LO!!!! What an Attitude!!! The lady on the other side is not bothered about the business I could give her, or the \\\"\"Word of Mouth\\\"\". All she had was, why dont you come here? When I told her where I lived, she was like, \\\"\"For one, we dont divulge our concept/menu on the phone.....Anyways it is very far for you\\\"\". Some attitude for a person who has just started a business.\\nWorst customer service I have ever come across.", "...not a fan. \\n\\nThey messed up on 3 of our separate orders; not blending it, boba when asked for jelly, and a completely different flavor. Were pretty veteran boba drinkers so we know what we want and we know how to order it so it was a big surprise that ALL THREE of our orders were incorrect.\\n\\nWe let the cashier know and asked if we could have simple adjustments but she looked confused and said no.

Granted, some of the suites there are nice and luxurious, but the customer service was horrible! I stayed at the hotel and made reservations for one room with double beds that was non-smoking.  When I tried to check-in they said they didn't have any rooms with double beds available!\\n\\nBecause I was with my friends, we couldn't just get a king size bed, so I had to wait at the front desk for a long time and then a double room finally became available, and I took it.  Unfortunately, when I arrived in the room, you can smell the cigarette smoke right away.  Apparently, the guy gave me a smoking room!  After calling the front desk about this, they said they couldn't give me a non-smoking double bed room.  After some complaining, they said they finally just got one that should be ready soon and that I would need to call them back in 30 minutes.  Long story short, it took me 1.5 hours and 4-5 phone calls to the front desk to finally get me that room they said would take 30 minutes.  \\n\\nAfter this experience, I don't think I will ever stay there again.  The Palazzo and Venetian are so much better with the price of their rooms and more importantly, their customer service.", "Finally a Paradise Bakery near me! I don't have to drive all the way to Scottsdale for them anymore! No longer will my family be forced to make an adventure across the other side of town to pick up my cookie cake because I hate real cake! \\n\\nRight?\\n\\nWrong. This Paradise Bakery just plain sucks. I still order my cookie cakes and cookies from here because it's convenient but I would never eat their food. I've tried eating here twice. Once an albacore sandwich that tasted like someone died inside of it (not the fish). The second time was just pasta salad. How do you mess up pasta salad? TELL ME. Another time my cousin ordered tomato soup and she found what we presumed to be part of a plastic spoon inside of it. How does that even happen? Are they intentionally messing with us or did they really just serve us used soup?\\n\\nThis location is always packed. I've never come here and not had to wait in line for at least ten minutes. That and the employees (besides ONE old lady who works there) are total jerks. I'm serious. Dude you work at Paradise Bakery for a living. Don't talk down to me when I'm trying to order a cookie. \\n\\nI only come here to get my Mr Pibb fix or to buy my mom cookies. Their cookies are just as good as any other Paradise. I have no idea what happened to their food or who trained their employees.", "Had my wedding Reception here on August 16th. LET ME FIRST START OFF BY SAYING THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS ESTABLISHMENT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE OF MRS PENNY FUSSELL (BANQUET EVENTS COORDINATOR) OTHER THAN THAT IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVES I WOULD HAVE. \\n\\nMy Wedding Reception took place in the la cascada banquet room  . The banquet crew kept several of my decor items. Which were later mailed back to me after raising awareness of the miss items to Mrs. Fussell\\n\\nSeveral Items that me and my husband prepaid for through the banquet ( Very Expensive) were discarded by banquet crew without awareness. \\n\\nVery disappointed with this action. Working Class doesn't have money to throw away I would have appreciated if a member of the team came up to us prior to discarding our items and asked if we like them boxed.\\n\\nThis didn't happen. I raised awareness to Mrs. Fussell (listed above) She was very apologetic and said that she can only due what the banquet director allowed and at this point the director was not willing to compensate or replace the discarded items.\\n\\nPoor Customer Service and Bad Business on the Director End. For this establishment to call itself a four star resort your business ethnics are horrible to hassle your customer over  compensation of nearly $300 dollars worth of prepaid items. Will Take my business to a competitor Next Time. \\n\\nI will continue to reflect my complaints with other entities such as Forbes magazine and Better Business Bureau", "Too much hype, not enough substance.\\n\\nThis place aims high but misses. \\n\\nThe not so sterling brunch buffet does provide a variety of offerings not common to run-of-the-mill buffets. This Sunday morning, the hot selection, among other things, included lobster tails, duck breasts and lamb chops. The cold selection was highlighted by plated salmon lox as well as domestic caviar and its accouterments. The above were sandwiched between champagne service at the table and bite-sized sweets and fruit selections for desert.\\n\\nShamefully most of the hot protein was well overcooked or had been sitting on the line for too long. The lobster tail was rubbery, the duck was inedible and the lamb... well just not good.\\n\\nAt the table while our hard working server tried to keep pace, she fell well short. Two rounds of dishes were not bused, coffee could not be ordered alongside desert and the final bill had to be sought from the passing manager. \\n\\nWe had high hopes for this visit based on previous reports but I guess there is only so much quality that can be delivered on a buffet line. There is no excuse however for poor service. At more than $80 per parson (not including gratuity) excellent service is the least that must be provided. If this brunch returns post-construction, hopefully it will be better staffed and managed.", "Maybe the food here is good. Too bad my boyfriend and I had left in outrage before we even got that far.\\n\\nCame here due to a hankering for pho and had our orders ready immediately. The servers, however, NEVER CAME. We had even asked the busser to call our server but no one came to take our order! We also made eye contact with a cluster of idle servers and gave the \\\"\"what's up with us not getting service\\\"\" motion and one mockingly returned the gesture with his own smug shoulder shrug. WHAT!?!\\n\\nLeft after 15 minutes of these shenanigans.", "Super disappointed with this property!  I think they must be experiencing some financial difficulty although their occupancy was pretty high. I was here for 5 nights from March 9th. \\n\\nI pulled up to the front - waited, waited, looked and looked. There was NO ONE to come get my bags or car.  Yes, it was 5:00 pm on Sunday which is one of their busiest days, but no staff to greet guests.  I went inside to check in counter and said there was no one outside, they then called the bell dept and had someone show up.  When I said I was checking in and handed them my keys they said I had to go to the valet parking spot, drove there and they said oh no, you have to park in the check in lot - which was around the building!  So far, bad impression. No longer can you pull up to a hotel to check in.  You have to park 3/4 miles away.  No doorman to greet you. I ended up carrying my own bags.\\n\\nCheck in clerk was pleasant, but my \\\"\"guaranteed\\\"\" room was not available.  After asking her to check again - 3 times, finally a king bed room appeared.  I was not told a thing about the hotel, no map, nothing - just room keys. I went over to Total Rewards to get my card, and given a little more info.\\n\\nRoom was clean, spacious and nicely decorated but smelled like bacon.  The housekeeper was super nice and called and had someone come up to spray the room, adjust the temperature in the refrigerator. They all came promptly.  I did notice each day when I returned to the room it smelled like food.  I asked the engineer who came in to adjust the brightness on the TV about it and he said I was above the ventilation fans for a restaurant below.  I was on the 9th floor. It wasn't bad or I would have asked to move. I felt there was something missing from my room - no hotel directory. I called and asked about it, front desk knew nothing about it and I never got one.  Odd, nothing which lists what is here, what hours they are open and what they offer. \\n\\nThe internet is horrible! the connection time is around 5 minutes and I kept having to login whenever my computer went to sleep, I left with my computer and came back, or changed browsers. \\n\\nMy biggest disapointment is the Masquerade in the Sky is NO LONGER HERE!!! That is the main reason I made my reservation here :(  Also, the buffet is very expensive.  I seem to remember $14.95 for lunch - it is now $21.95 if you are a total rewards, and dinner is $29.95.  (there is a groupon avail now for dinner,  2 for price of 1) the seafood buffet dinner is $49.95!  Good grief! The buffet looked nice, but it encourages people to eat way more than they should just to get their money's worth.  No wonder America is obese!\\n\\nThere is a Vietnamese restaurant which wasn't too expensive, kind of fast food like , prices were around $12.95, The sports cafe was next to it with prices starting at $8.95, but you can buy a piece of pizza for $4.95.\\n\\nOne of the best things about this place was the spa. Very nicely laid out, perfect amenities and very clean. Use is included with the day use fee. Unfortunately it closes at 7:00 PM. The fitness center is located here. My day use fee was supposed to be $22.00 but appears as $24.60 on my bill - I guess they tax it?\\n\\nThe casino is nothing special, lots of penny slots if you like those. Smoking is allowed in this casino and very noticeable.  All in all, the best things that were here are no longer what make it the best. It is very noticeable that they have cut down on staff.  Vegas is still busy no matter when you come here, I don't get it!\\n\\nPool area is nice but the hours are very limited. It closes at 6:00 PM. Not sure if they have longer hours in the spring and summer, but for March it seemed pretty limited. When I went out there none of the bars or eating places were open. again, staff cutbacks. \\n\\nThe Starbucks in the hallway on the way to the Ipanema Tower elevators is always open and very busy! Happy hour special: from 10:00PM to 11:00 PM all pastries are $2.00! They have two Starbucks here for your coffee fix. They do have Keurig coffee makers in the rooms,  so if you have a Keurig, bring your coffee pods with you because they don't seem to be available to purchase, or they are $8.00 for 3 (supposed to be in the in-room bar, but mine didn't have any)\\n\\nI passed a few other restaurants that weren't open so don't know if it was the hour I went by or if they just weren't open. \\n\\nTV channel selection was pretty bad, very limited channels.\\n\\nCompared to some of the newer hotel casinos, this place isn't that big. Which can be a plus. You only have to walk 3/4 mile to get to your car instead of 1 1/2! Felt isolated from the strip - it isn't walking distance, and the shuttles they have only run every 30 minutes. I wouldn't stay here again unless I was coming to a convention in this hotel. This is part of the very large Caesar's chain which includes Paris, Harrahs, Ballys, Casears.\\n\\nDon't expect much in the way of customer service. The bed is comfortable but the pillows are not!", "Zero stars, ya digggg. 1 star because i had to. This place is the shitter hole. I tried 2 other LV Buffets, and take my advice: GO STRAIGHT TO the Wicked Spoon Buffet at The Cosmopolitan. Best gosh darn food, ginormous selections, and great service. All the sites say it's the best, and hands down, it is. \\n\\nMandalay Bayside Buffet had the worst crap to eat + shittt service. So bad that we asked to talk to the manager, and she didnt do anything about our experience. NO one cleared our tables the whole hour we were there. When we walked personally to get the managers attention, she was snooty towards us. SAYONARA MAH DUDES won't be giving you a 2nd chance because of your uncaring restaurant presence. So many other choices, you should be on top of your game.\\n\\n\\nWaste of my hard earned Vegas money.", "Go to this place if you want mega portions of food reheated in a microwave and a server who just yells at you from across the room rather than walking over.  \\n\\nThe mashed potatoes were at least a day old and of a dry and mealy consistency and under seasoned and cool in the center.  The wings were small and normal in flavor.  The macaroni and cheese was so extremely average and greasy and again under heated.  The meatloaf was the largest portion of meat I have ever seen on a plate.  It was completely absurd.  I laughed.  This mound of meat was at least a pound.  probably more.  it was massive!  It was so lukewarm and under heated and had too much of a wet spongy spongy consistency.  I'm glad I didn't order it.  and can you guess it was under heated.  Some portions of food would be piping hot and some would be cool.  Classic symptoms of microwave heating.  \\n\\nSo lovely to sit down to a mega sized microwave dinner.  left overs are no consolation and I don't think its any coincidence that we forgot the leftovers on the table.  But wait.  its sad to think the meal itself was already a left over reheated.  \\n\\nThere is much, much, much better comfort food with better service at other places in town so I would advise to pass on this place.  We had a pretty negative experience.", "I just don't get the draw of buffets.  The quality of food is generally worse than if you'd order an entree at a normal restaurant, most restaurants serve portions that are big enough to satisfy already, the novelty of eating fried rice, prime rib, and pasta at the same time does not appeal to me, and you end up paying more than usual for this sub-par dinner.  \\n\\nGiven my disinterest in buffets, this one still ranks towards the bottom of buffets I've tried.  Nothing I tried was horrible per se, but it wasn't very good either.  That alone would be enough to earn a 2 star rating, but at almost $30 per person, this place loses another star.", "Much like Sam A. (4/12/2012) we had an incredibly disappointing experience with the food. Our server was better and more attentive, hence 2 stars instead of 1.\\n\\nTo start with we found the Spanakopita to be incredibly salty, like they used a tbsp instead of a tsp. My wife ordered the Broiled Chicken Pita which I have had before and is good, but this time it was a disaster. The chicken was cold and the pita was cold and stiff. It got sent back and we got a new one which was better but still not as good as the Chandler location that I have eaten at before. I ordered a spicy chicken lavosh wrap. Now I love spicy food, but besides being spicy, this had absolutely no flavor. It seemed as if the mix had been marinating for a few days killing off any flavors that the beautiful ingredients should have had. Again very disappointing.\\n\\nNot sure if it is because this is a new location or a large location for them, but I have experienced much better, and the food quality was so far off their standard it makes me hesitant about ever going back. It is not complicated food so it shouldn't be that hard to get it right.", "These guys won't last long. Phoned for a reservation, got message to leave a reservation request, left the message for a reservation (early evening). No call back. Tried again; no answer. Showed up to find they had booked the entire place for a full evening event. When asked why they did not call back to confirm or reject the reservation, they told me that was not their policy; it's up to the client to keep calling back until a real person is able to respond.  Now go figure on that one!", "Went out with friends.  They didn't get my dinner order. .. The ipad didn't work.  My food came when my friends were done eating and the shrimp was spoiled.

Now that I'm Yelping regularly, I come in today for lunch with the family and you completely disappoint me!  Here's the \\\"\"good\\\"\"....They had every football game imaginable on, so I was able to watch TV to distract me from the fact that the service was sub par and the food was worse.  \\n\\nI wasn't incredibly hungry, so I figured I'd have the small nachos.  Please sit down if you're not already, but Taco Bell has better nachos, oh yes, I said it.  Plain, barely salted nachos, diced flavorless tomatoes, sliced jalapenos, a small amount of cheese and a dollop of bad foodservice sour cream.  The chili, which I ordered on the side was equally as bad.  I tried to jazz them up with some salsa, I had to wait for 10 minutes for the waitress to materialize to ask for some.  She then disappeared for another 10 minutes and when she returned she plopped the most disgusting tasting foodservice salsa I ever had in my life in front of me with a \\\"\"sorry\\\"\".  Very disappointing.  I also ordered an unsweetened tea, which was very watery and the fact that they charge $3.50 for a drink is insulting, but if it was good tea, I wouldn't have noticed the overcharge.  \\n\\nI don't know what to say, and I have been here before and it was pretty good.  Today, Hickory Tavern you failed me.", "Rating on food alone.  Service was great.  Ate the miyagi San burger but my egg was well done and I was looking forward to a runny yolk since there was not really a spread. BUT the crispy onions were great.  Got the calamari but it tasted like raw flour.  I don't think I will come back being that this was my second upset here.", "Wow..ok here goes....purchased living social special. My mani pedi was almost three hours! I have had gel mani pedis before and it never took this long. my manicure didn't even include any type of lotion or massage which was odd. The cuticle pulling was too rough and I was charged a 5 dollar nail polish removal for regular nail polish on my toes which Ive been ever been charged at any nail salon. The lady kept messing up and had to redo all the while I am starving! The place was very dirty and some sort of fruit fly, cricket, and spider infestation was going on. Another customer actually had to tell someone to please kill a spider that was near her so she didnt have to stare at it anymore! The cricket chirping noise was so loud I could barely hear the music. I was ready to leave but somehow tried to tuff it out. My mani pedi was average but I never felt relaxed and pampered. I dont see this place lasting that long.", "Ugh, nothing worse than a hair in your food and a restaurant that won't comp a 13.00 sandwich rather than lose a customer.

Will NOT be going back there again.", "What do you do when you work somewhere that closes at 11pm and the current time is 10:53pm?\\n\\nHow about lock the door and not let anyone else in.  Or from the takeout window tell people sorry we are closed.\\n\\nThis is exactly what happened to us.  We spoke with the guy behind the sliding glass window and he told us that they could not make anything else because they had already begun to clean up for other night.  We pointed out the time and he said and I quote \\\"\"ya, sorry\\\"\".  We did get him to sell us a frozen hot chocolate and a diet Pepsi.  \\n\\nThe frozen hot chocolate tastes like a fudge flavored Popsicle, pretty good but not worth the 10 bucks they charged for it.\\n\\nWe sat at a table just outside the front door and watched as others approached and were turned away before the posted closing time.  We then watched as 17 groups over the next 25 minutes left disappointed.

Much better and much cheaper-", "First of all, shame on you Villa Pizza, you ruined my stay at the Red Rock. This was my first night at Red Rock and I was excited, tired and hungry! And what do you know? Villa pizza was selling there slices half off!! So with a family of four, I ordered an entire pizza of course not forgetting to ask if the pizza was fresh, bc we all know if it sounds too good to be true, it more than likely is. Well the guy reassured me they had just made the pizza so I paid $10 for a whole pizza, went to my room and chowed down w my husband, two year old and one year old babies. The next morning, our guts bubbles and our Vegas/Red Rock experience was completely ruined by and constantly interrupted by sprints to the nearest restroom. It was bad. Really bad. Luckily my babies didn't feel the wrath until we made it home last night. They had low grade fevers and woke up this morning with 103 degree temps. I gave the baby motrin and booked them for a trip to the doctor. I hate seeing them sick and I want to really slap the guy who KNEW the pizza was no good and SAW me with my babies yet still sold it to me and everyone one else behind us. Anything for a dollar right, Villa Pizza? That includes selling rank pizza???? I wouldn't have given it away for free. Have some morals and ethics. Shame on you!", "Was excited to visit Devanna Love, Its important to patronize Black establishments...I do have to say my 1st experience wasn't so good, When I entered the store I didn't see anyone, then after a few minutes a young lady stuck her head out of the dressing room and said hello, I thought she was a customer since she was trying on clothes during regular business hours, Nor was she very friendly. Customer service is the main KEY to a successful business.", "I realize that most people who need a phone usually don't check reviews on Yelp, but for those that do, stay away from this location. These people are trained to tell bald face lies in order to make sales. The reason I say trained is because I've seen a pattern with the employees. I was told in March of 2011 that I should buy a 4G Samsung 1 because 4G would be coming out any day. A year and 1/2 later I dropped the phone and cracked the scree and still on contract I told them I did not want an upgraded Samsung III if they weren't coming out of 4G anytime soon, the the next employee sounded like he was giving me the same sale pitch the first one did, that 4G was coming out, giving me that nudge to spend more money than I wanted to.\\n\\nAlso I was sold a Sprint MIFI and I was told you could go anywhere at anytime and connect to the internet. After about 6 visits to this location for tech support, we end up resetting the thing each time, but if I'm in the field, and since that's required every single time I use it, I might as well just use my phone for internet and save 10-15 minutes. I paid $100 of this Piece of cr..p thing and $37 per month and they flat out refuse to let me out of the contract.\\n\\nI was being sarcastic when the manager after several tech support visits between my phones and MIFI asked me my name and I told him he should know it by now, and his response was that I should be thankful that at least someone was helping me.\\n\\nIt's damn near a monopoly, but not quite.

The cuts have been fine, but their business practices leave much to be desired.  They constantly change their marketing/incentive programs, and refuse to honor what they had in place before.

Dont waste your time, The topping were awful as well.", "This place reminds me of one of those crackhead hotels that sell their rooms at \\\"\"conveniently\\\"\" discounted rates while maintaining the allure of a wannabe family-friendly Holiday Inn kind of atmosphere.\\n\\nIt's where, while mom and dad are having their cheapo anniversary beneath the moonlight next to a pool polluted with urine (there is no such as a blue dye that marks piss as a cloud, it's a movie joke derives from a myth spread by little kids, like \\\"\"cooties\\\"\"), and while the kids are either sleeping or watching late night shows, the room NEXT DOOR has four tweakers working out a drug deal from a vicious looking motherfucker with tattoos all over his face, and a handgun with lines of meth laid out before a table.\\n\\nThat's what you are bringing your kids too. Tell them to cover their ears and keep their heads down when a gunshot goes off.\\n\\nThe entrance is very difficult to make a left turn into if you are heading south on Las Vegas Blvd. The locals floor it on the gas without reading the speed limit signs and cut each other off as you are, in sheer terror, trying to get your family of 6 into the valet area. Which brings me to another part of the review.\\n\\nThere is ABSOLUTELY no customer service at the valet. I had my car siting there for TEN minutes. No uniformed guys came running up to take my key and my car. There were THREE other cars in front of me also waiting for some fucking CUSTOMER SERVICE.\\n\\nThe sprinklers on the north side of the hotel are BROKEN, gushing wasted money towards the asphalt instead of into the bushes.

The cashier said we're out of margaritas until Monday.  Unfortunately, she didn't think it was that big of a deal.  I decided to leave, based on her response.

This is the 2nd Asian buffet I've newly tried in the past 6 months and is the same result - STRIKE!\\nThey advertise a dinner special where you can order either steak or lamb chops, one piece per person....don't do it!  The steak is pounded flat and served way over cooked...the grill cook is so rude and all the other servers just stand around talking to each other.  Floors were disgusting....how do people even like this place!? With the lack of cleanliness of both their dining area as well as their parking lot area, thank god neither of us ended up with food poisoning!", "Bad experience.  Terrible food.  I came with four friends. Three of us had grilled cheese varieties (their specialty), one got a burger, and one got a steak sandwich. We had poutine fries and wings for appetizers. Everything we ate was bad. The burger says well done in the menu. It was raw. Not rare. Raw. The wings were soggy and tasted like liver. The poutine fries had no cheese curds, meaning they were not poutine fries. They were just fries with gravy. And not good gravy. The grilled cheese came with tomato soup which tasted like BBQ sauce and served luke warm. The grilled cheese sandwiches were served on bland Texas toast and were mediocre at best. Additionally, plates would be nice. They serve the sandwiches on cutting boards and we all ended up with crumbs all over us. The sweet potato fries were soggy and luke warm - although to be fair, this is true most places. Sweet potato fries are usually this way. The steak sandwich was disgusting. No seasoning. 10% steak, 90% bread. Two star rating only because the staff was cool and they have good beer on tap. Avoid eating here.", "Very disappointed that they forgot to bring the dip I ordered, it was a special one they have on the menu, when I pointed that out to the server, he just said they did not charge me for it, but he did not even apologize.

Definitely NOT coming back!", "My husband & I ate at Grand Lux our last morning in Vegas as a send off before boarding the plane. \\n\\nI had thought that it would have such great food due to the reviews and/or the menu selection. \\n\\nI admit that we should have just gone with the breakfast buffet which was quicker and cheaper overall. \\n\\nI ordered the eggs and bacon and it was just 'okay'.

A few weeks ago on a Saturday night I was alone and sitting at the counter.  It was 10PM and I ordered the shrimp with linguine.  After waiting 45 minutes I said something to my server.  She said they were busy but my shrimp were on the fire.  15 minutes later I still have no food.  Then some friends came in and I moved to their table, and after they ordered their food my food finally arrived.  There was no linguine only over cooked spaghetti, a few overcooked shrimp and no garlic bread.  Well this past Saturday night were were in there again and I ordered the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail to start.  After ordering our waiter came over to say they were out of shrimp and it would be a few minutes before they cooked more.  Then the waiter comes to our table with a plate of the worst looking shrimp which were below par of their buffet ones and I promptly told him to bring them back, there was no way I would pay $11 for that.  About 10 minutes later waiter comes back to the table with their version of Jumbo Shrimp, warm and not very good.  I was insulted they would even serve that to me, a high level player at that casino.  I had informed the manager when I paid the bill that they never should have served the shrimp and he politely said he knew.  If he knew why was it served to me?  Bottom line here is that a comp isn't even worth it!!!  Service was OK, but the rest of the meal, including my rib eye which was ordered medium and came out barely cooked, was awful.  I did not send the steak back because at that point in our meal I thought I will just take it home and eat it tomorrow.", "While the staff are great, I'm not thrilled with Dr Ben. While initially for a 'check up' he was great but when further work had to be done, he became arrogant and refused to listen to my concerns. He was unwilling to work together to find a suitable solution to my problem - as he way was the best and only. \\n\\nFor a quick check up, you might want to give him a go, but for any further dental procedures, I'd find a dentist who is willing to discuss things with you, listen to your concerns and problems and NOT put his hand up to stop you talking because he doesn't want to listen.", "NOT our cup of tea. \\n\\nWith that said, the place is cute and the workers are nice so I would love to give them more stars but I'm basing it solely on our taste.  \\n\\nThese are not ordinary waffles but liege waffles meaning they are infused with sugar balls in them. We were expecting more options than liege waffles since our whole family love waffles but guess we didn't research enough. \\n\\nWe ordered 1) plain, 2) whipped cream 3) nutella & berries. The plain enough was so sweet that we could barely finish it. My son who LOVES waffles and nutella AND whipped cream took 2 bites and said he couldn't eat it. \\n\\nIf you love sugary stuff this is the place for you!

Tonight, the food sucked pretty bad. My daughter's chicken parmesan was dry and overcooked, and the pasta was dry. My food was ok. The beneighs tasted as if they hadn't changed the grease is a while. I was really disappointed. They comp'ed my daughters dinner and sent us home with a 6 pack of muffins. Would not go back. The mistakes made were too egregious.", "Terrible!! It wouldve gotten 0 stars if that was allowed.  Went there with my bf on an allegedly Jello Wrestling Sunday only to find this club to have very little going on.  Two girls wrestled in the inflatable pool for about 5 minutes and then that was all for the jello wrestling.  On the website they make you believe that jello wrestling is a big deal there on Sundays and then you get there and after the five minutes of jello wrestling the club is basically dead as a doornail. During the jello wrestling, there are no other girls on stage. After the wrestling, there is 1 girl on stage and the others walking around the club soliciting dances. The club was not the Deja of yesteryear. My bf  had been there about 4 years ago and it was crazy and much wilder, with way better looking girls. These girls were nothing to look at with faces for radio. I didnt want a lap dance from any of them. Deja was dark, dank and sad. My bf and I went there planning on lap dances and a wild time, and wound up paying the insane cover of $25 each, and left after about 45 minutes. I wouldnt recommend Deja to anyone.

Well an emergency came up.....my husband came home from work and found our elderly German Shepherd couldnt walk and the dog was very distressed.   We assumed he must have had a stroke or something.  While my husband was loading our dog into our car, I called Estrella Animal hospital to let them know we were coming in with an emergency and may have to put our dog down.    I was then told that it was a Friday and they are closing in 45 minutes and they could not see our dog.  I had explained we were regular clients, and also spoke with office mananager who told me the same thing.....I was shocked and greatly disappointed.   We were dealing with the potential loss of our beloved pet and were being told to take our dog elsewhere.  \\n\\nWell Estrella refered us to Goodyear Animal Hospital which is actually closer to our house, who was able to see our dog immediately.

It's a classy show.  But the choreography is just boring and not at all sexy -- seriously, I've seen hotter moments on Dancing With The Stars.  I suppose I had thought that the play of lights on the dancers' bodies would allow for some really interesting and creative dance...but for the most part, it was just some synchronized kicks and bad lip-synching.  I'd rather see some well-choreographed erotic dance with clothes on.\\n\\nWorse still, we had the misfortune to be there when Carmen Electra was performing with them.  She's a pretty girl, but she's not a great dancer and with her gravity-defying boobs, she just had no business being up on stage with the showgirls.\\n\\nI wholeheartedly agree with Roland S. -- the Crazy Horse show was a waste of time, other than the really amusing interlude with the break dancers.\\n\\nGo see Zumanity instead.  I wish I'd just gone to see that again.", "Blah to the extreme. The McRib at McDonalds is more flavorful and priced much more economically.\\n\\nI ordered the surf and turf special.

Was like sawing through a brick with a chop stick.

However, after one visit, I quickly decided this wasn't the place for me. There's absolutely nothing special about Target; it's basically a cleaned up version of Zellers' twin. Even the color scheme is similar. I hated Zellers! It was such a dull and depressing store - kinda like Dunkin Donuts - the place where retail souls go to die. No thanks. \\n\\nAll of that being said, the Canadian version doesn't carry the same stuff as the US. I went there in great hopes of finally finding a very specific item that I know the US stores carry, only to leave empty-handed. Me no likey - too much hypey.", "First off, the food was excellent, but I can't rate any higher for this visit as it took over 3 hours from when we sat to when the last diner got their check. We had 8 attentive people Sunday evening waiting to sample their Restaurant Week menu. The offerings were superb and everyone found something to like. However, the time between courses ran sometimes 20-30 minutes. During the first course, everyone received their plate of hot food (some salads) except for one. It took way to long to reserve. Then came time for the check. SInce their were eight of us we asked what would be the easiest for her and she said individually. That's always perferred since people have more alcohol than others, etc., but it turned into a nightmare. From that moment until the first person got their check was almost an hour. Seriously, our waitress was not prepared or at a level of sophistication a restaurant like that should employ. I'll go back someday, but I will not sit at her station.", "This place was horrible. Do not go here.", "All show, no delicious burrito.\\n\\nThis place is a decent spot for a group of people to meet for a quick bit, drinks, and a walk to Mill Ave.  It is not, however, a good Mexican restaurant.\\n\\nThe service was very slow.  We had 5 people and all of us were drinking, yet our server seemed completely uninterested in our party.  Typically, this would not be the case unless the place was slammed and leaking extraneous guests, but on this night there were not a whole lot of folks in-house.\\n\\nThe food was so-so.  Chimichanga was the best dish I sampled, but it was not impressive.  I'd rather have Chipotle any day.\\n\\nThe Sahara Rd. Vegas location is much better and much more accomodating.  Maybe this location could learn a thing or two from its other franchises.", "I will admit that it has been a while since I went to Stripsteak, but when I did go I was very disappointed. I went with my fiance for our one nice dinner out while in town.  The atmosphere is very beautiful and appealing, but that doesn't mean anything when the food is mediocre. The steak I ordered medium rare was burnt and overcooked. I like a little char on my steak, but I don't want so much that it takes away from the beautiful taste of the well raised beef they use.  I should have sent it back, so part of the fault lies on me for not saying anything. I could tell the waitress was having a bad night though, so I didn't want to add to it.\\nThe best thing we had all night was their complimentary fries cooked in duck fat. Considering we spent well over $100, I'd expect to enjoy a little more than the fries.

There was a Taco Bell located right across the street from BHS (my high school), and if memory serves, the drive-thru was open pretty damn late; maybe even 24 hours?!  At the time, my friends and I made many a \\\"\"run for the border,\\\"\" and I remember the food being great!\\n\\nEither I was really drunk back then or Taco Bell has gone down hill or my taste buds have matured quite a bit since then, because after eating Taco Bell for dinner last night, I no longer \\\"\"quiero Taco Bell.\\\"\"  Or maybe I ordered wrong?\\n\\nI'm quite nauseous thinking about what I ordered (and ate) last night:\\n-1 Mexican Pizza (540 calories / 30 grams of fat)\\n-1 Chicken Soft Taco (180 calories / 6 grams of fat)\\n-1 Pintos and Cheese (170 calories / 6 grams of fat)\\n\\nI didn't know there was a \\\"\"Drive-Thru Diet\\u00ae Menu\\\"\" until looking at their website just now either... oh well, I'm eating for two right now!\\n\\nI also didn't realize the slogan changed to \\\"\"think outside the bun\\\"\" until actually listening to the radio commercials as I drove home with my food in my lap last night.    I will say that the drive-thru was super quick and my order was right and all for under $6.  What a bargain!\\n\\nI'm sure Taco Bell is still a great option when you're out late, have had a few too many, and/or are eating on a budget.  But I don't recommend it when you're completely sober and it's a normal hour.

My boyfriend and I ordered Bacon cheeseburgers, they completely forgot the cheese and the buns disinigrated when we took a bite. They were so stale! No where near edible.

He ordered the bone in rib eye and I got the tasting plate.  Both our steaks were flavorless and I'm not sure if they do that on purpose because they also serve an exotic salt tasting tray to put on the entrees (is it diy entree seasoning??).  My pork was so dry I wanted to spit it out.  The fish was okay.  The parmesan fries were alright but I was expecting somethign orgasmic based on reviews from others.

I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.\\n\\nOkay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. \\n\\nI sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived.

So.  I yelped this place like I do before I go just about anywhere.  My Mom had a gift card for here from someone and didn't want it, so she said I could use it during my quick visit home.

It's all one big open room with like half walls separating massage areas.  A nice lady comes in to do her thing, and she was sweet and did an alright job.  But I couldn't chill cause you hear all the slapping from everyone else, people coming and going, side conversations... But okay fine, this is technically a free massage afterall, so, fine.  Then she covers my eyes, and continues to work.  And when the towel was removed from my eyes, a GUY had been massaging me!  I have no idea when they switched!  I don't care that a guy was doing it, but it was a shock to suddenly see a different face.  \\n\\nThen I'm told to lay face down.  Mr. Massager starts going off on me like I'm his punching bag.  I'm wondering what I ever did to this guy to deserve this beating.  But I tell myself, Okay maybe it's toxins leaving my system or whatever, maybe I should expect some discomfort, and I tough it out.  BUT THEN.  Homeboy gets a candy out of this dish that's sitting on this little table and proceeds to roll it around in his mouth and suck on it and slobber all over it for the remainder of my treatment.  SO GROSS.  And he's rubbing all deep and somehow manages to basically lay his junk all over my head while he's doing it.  I'm half laughing and half totally embarrassed and disgusted to even type that!  UGHGHHH!  There was zero communication, he pulls up my shirt and unhooks my BRA and I'm thinking, DID I YELP THE CORRECT PLACE???  (For the record, yes, I did yelp the correct place).

Poor Rao's is really going downhill. \\n\\nWe dined here in 2010 and had a marvelous time. It is pricey, but for a special occasion... the pasta is excellent. \\n\\nCut to New Year's Eve 2012. I made an 8 pm reservation 6 months in advance. I called to confirm the reservation 3 days prior to the date. At no time did anyone mention to me that this restaurant does a mandatory prix fixe (price fixed) menu on New Year's. (Important Note: I don't eat meat) So our cute little party of 4 arrives at the restaurant, excited for a stellar meal, and we are informed by a polite hostess of the prix fixe menu. This menu is $140 per person. It does not include wine or drinks. The main course has no vegetarian options and there are no substitutions. \\n\\nWe were pissed and disappointed. We are not cheap, but none of us wanted a four course heavy meal that evening.  \\n\\nMoved our reservation to the next night with no problem (I really just wanted a nice bowl of pasta, Jesus). We show up the next day and are quickly whisked to a TINY booth. \\n\\nLong story short: \\nWe order from a friendly waiter and receive several appetizers and dishes. The flavors are lovely, my fiance was particularly impressed with the bolognese sauce. Unfortunately for me, my first bite of Linguine and Clams with red sauce was FULL of sand and grit. OWW! My tooth!  I should have sent the dish back but figured I just had bad luck and soldiered on stupidly. Again the flavors were great, but when a guest is paying $30 for a plate of pasta, the kitchen better make damn sure there isn't SAND in the clam shells! \\n\\nAs we left, I mentioned my issue to a manager, just to let him know so that he could alert the kitchen. He could not have cared less. He gave me a half-assed, \\\"\"I'm Sorry,\\\"\" and walked off. Ass. \\n\\nWe will not be back.", "OMG! The worst place ever to get your dog groomed!

Each time she ignored my requests for the style cut that I wanted for my dog and then she had attitude about it.

Empty (it's obvious why - first RED FLAG). Sub-par food, even worse service. Stopped in because I wasn't in the mood for sushi or pizza, which are the only other options in the plaza.

Adam dodges phone calls, emails, and cowards in person. Our wedding photography package was simple and was promised to be delivered no later than 30 days post wedding. No excuse for this behavior. I'm convinced the photos were deleted, lost, or ruined. If that is the case, he has no back bone and lacks the integrity to explain what happened. We have afforded him every opportunity to make this right, however he is in hiding. If he is the last photography company on earth (and I use the word company and photography loosely) and you have to use his services, coordinate with the independent photographers he contracts out.

It used to be a touch of home, but prices have gone way up, and service has gone way down.  My last visit left me feeling nickeled and dimed to death.  Truth told, it was more dollared to death.  I ordered a bagel and lox plate and was given a tiny amount of cream cheese. When I ran out and asked for more..... they charged me $2.29.  They never brought my table any pickles, and they charged extra for someone's bread.  We had to flag down the waitress a couple of times.  She never stopped at our table unless we sent someone to find her.  We left having spent almost $60 for 3 breakfast entrees, and that is pretty sad.", "Could have been better. Drink service was good but food service was terrible. Also, delays between meat service was more than 10 min.

Maybe we hit it on an off night? .. hope so..  regardless, will not go back.", "The habachi is way to expensive for the portion that they serve.  For hibachi steak & shrimp they charge 18.00, which is more then the prices on other hibachi places and they cook infront of you.  For 18.00 the portions were really small.  Usually I'm not able to eat the whole meal in other hibachi restaurants but in Yama, I ate the whole meal (besides the soup, didn't like it) and was still a little hungry.  Place is nice. Food was okay, portions were horrible.  I do not recommend it.", "I was hungry and I needed to pee.  What can I say?  The bathroom doors are locked and the associates have to buzz you in.  You would think they would be clean -- not so much.  I was able to get myself a two-cheeseburger meal to sate my hunger.  Oof...it was another bathroom run soon after.", "If you're interested in a Brazilian wax, go elsewhere. Was left with a lot of remaining wax on my skin, a lot of hair that could have easily been waxed off and no backside or tweeting was done at all. In all honesty and fairness, it seemed as though the lady was not comfortable performing a brazilian, which is totally ok, but I wish they would have said something prior or told me when someone would have been in that can perform one at better quality.", "Went as a group of 9 to kick off a fun night on Mill. I don't know who suggested it but my girlfriend and I had no say in the matter. (I would've been fine with Five Guys.) So we show up at Caffe Boa and it looks great - the decor is nice, there are a lot of people there, all signs are good so far.\\n\\nThen we sit down and take a peak at the menu - everything seems very overpriced, but being the optimistic type, I assume this means it will be really good. Well, you know what they say about making assumptions...\\n\\nFor a drink I ordered a Sugarfree Vodka Red Bull. Nothing too special, so it's relatively hard to screw up. Somehow, they managed to. The ratio was entirely off and I ended up with a bitter glass of ice and vodka that barely tasted like Red Bull. If I wanted to get screwed up it would have been great but that's what the rest of the night on Mill was for.\\n\\nThen came dinner. Girlfriend and I were a bit hungry, but probably not hungry enough to eat what had been described as \\\"\"huge portions,\\\"\" so we decided to split. A seafood lover at heart, I suggested we try the scallop/lobster/crab ravioli. I have a feeling if I had ordered something else, this would be a very different review.\\n\\nWhat arrived at the table, next to huge dishes of pasta that almost nobody managed to finish, was a dish with five raviolis in it. FIVE. The dish was $22 so for those too lazy to do the math, that's $4.40 per ravioli. Between the two of us - that's 2.5 raviolis each. \\\"\"What,\\\"\" I believe was the first reaction to the dainty portion.\\n\\nI could have literally bought two cans of Chef Boyardee for that amount. And upon tasting Caffe Boa's seafood ravioli, it was clear the Boyardee would have been more satisfying. If I had been there alone, this would not have been such a sour experience, but getting to watch our friends dig in to what appeared to be much more savory dishes and not even finish them was heart-wrenching for a food lover like myself.\\n\\nWe ate the raviolis in a fraction of the time it took everyone to \\\"\"finish\\\"\" their dish. And by finish, I mean eat as much as they could, wave a small white flag, and request a box for leftovers. Everyone else appeared to enjoy their food but from a taste standpoint, a portion standpoint, and a logic standpoint, the ravioli shouldn't even be an option on the menu. Substantially less food than the other menu items would only make sense if it was delicious, and it wasn't. I've never disliked lobster or scallops like that.\\n\\nCertainly an experience I don't want to repeat. If I could ever fathom making a return trip, I obviously wouldn't be having the ravioli. What makes me the most angry, though - we told the waiter we were going to split. Why didn't he warn us we were paying $22 for less than half an (unappetizing) appetizer?\\n\\nOverpriced is something you earn. Caffe Boa has not earned this distinction.", "Renters Beware!!! Biggest rip off ever ! The fast talk about their insurance cost me about  $115 extra . Rental estimate was $135 online , get there in person 262.  I really pissed off now . But wait there's more .

Nice decor.  The food was adequate, but $13 for the turkey pastrami sandwich was a little high for a lunch.  I guess those chandeliers are expensive and rent at the Waterfront cannot be cheap.  Our server was poorly trained.  She placed the food in front of me instead of the lady first. I asked for water and the server brought only one glass of water and didn't bother to ask about the lady's needs.  This venue is not for those who appreciate fine or even appropriate service.  Sam needs to educate his young servers on the finer points of courtesy.  Our server was also extremely bored with her job, her life, and her existence.  That's the impression we received.", "Such a disappointment.  Really wish that a pub with a great location and amazing food offered better service.

At the beginning of our order, I notified her that I will need to place a to go order toward the end of the meal. She walked by our table many times, while our water glasses were empty, she never once stop to ask us if we needed anything or just fill our water glasses. \\n\\nI then asked her nicely, that when she had a chance, could we get some more water. She then said, \\\"\"don't you need to place an order to go?\\\"\" I said \\\"\"yes, but when you bring the water, we can do it then\\\"\".

The person I spoke to was quite rude over the phone, but said they make decisions regarding admittance on a case by case basis. I told him we were a large group, would buy drinks, and as a former dancer, all my friends are schooled to pay the dancers well! When we got there, we were met at the door and told we would have to pay full cover and that they wouldn't do anything special for our bachelor. Lucky for us, our driver got a tip to go the the Hi-Liter, which turned out the be the best ever!! So, again, shame on you Bombshells! And to the girls who missed out on lots of money that night... go work at a real club! Peace", "Came here tonight since my wife is traveling to see what the place is like. I really wanted to like this place, very close to my house. I would like to echo that the service and people are fantastic. However, the food is a 4 on a 10 scale. The Generals's chicken was heavily breaded, made of chicken parts and very salty. I am a bit of a health nut so I was hoping for more white chicken than bread. Fried rice was nice and so was the hot and sour soup. Would be nice to have some healthy options on the menu. I would pay an up charge for chicken breast not breaded.", "For being in the Palms, which would like to think that it is super cool and trendy and hip, this place was not that great.  \\n\\nMy friends and I came here after we got bored at the Playboy Club and this place was not much better.

We ordered rib tips, links, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, potato salad, coleslaw, peach cobbler and caramel cake all to go.  It took over 45 min for our order to be ready.  I would think the sides and desserts are already prepared and just need to scooped in a container.  So the wait was for links and rib tips?  The smokers were not on when we were there so we weren't waiting for meat.  \\n\\nCustomer service could have been friendlier.  They customer in front of me asked what sides they had and the guy taking orders just hit the menu where the sides were listed.

When I pressed the issue he said I can get a 2 item combo and just get all hotlink.  I ordered that but why not just sell a link for $3 or $4 bucks?  After 40 min of waiting and seeing people order after me get their food I asked how long it would be and was told very gruffly that they are \\\"\"very busy\\\"\".  They were busy but I ordered before the lunch rush started.  I was also sitting in the booth next to the register so I could hear the orders and knew who was picking up phone orders, etc.  Also during the 45 min I waited at least 5 people told him the coke was out.  It was still out when I left.  \\n\\nOk.  On to the most important part the food.  Cause really, I will wait for hours and put up with bad service for some awesome BBQ.  \\n\\nSweet Tea- Not good.  I actually switched to soda and I rarely drink soda.  \\n\\nRib tips- Hubby thought they were ok.  I'm not a big beef rib person but thought they were ok also.  `\\n\\nLinks- No way that was 2 portions of links from my 2 meat combo.  It wasn't even 1 small link total.  But that is ok since they were so dried out it looked like they were days old.  I have never seen meat that dry in my entire life.  I'm being generous to say they looked like they were sliced the day before and left in the warmer overnight.  \\n\\nMac n cheese- very bland, noodles overcooked, could have used salt or real cheese.  \\n\\nMashed Potatoes-  Instant.  Yes they use instant potatoes.  All the other stuff there is good.  If they would use real potatoes it would probably be amazing.  \\n\\nPotato Salad- This was the best out of all the sides.  It was ok but wouldn't order it again.  \\n\\nColeslaw- Ok.  \\n\\nPeach cobbler- Cold.  Who serves cold peach cobbler?  Again ok.  Not great.  \\n\\nCaramel Cake- Yellow cake topped with caramel syrup, like the kind you buy for sundaes.  This was actually not bad.  I might even try it at home.  \\n\\nAll the sides seemed just a little spice away from being good.  Maybe I went on an off day.  I don't know.  After reading everyone's reviews I was so excited to come here and had high hopes for what I thought was going be my new favorite BBQ place.  I was heartbroken at how bad it was.

We started with the gnocchi which had wild mushrooms and parmesan fondue, which was pretty good. We also ordered the steamed broccolini. The steak was definitely not worth the money, because the outside was cooked to a slight crisp (not a problem for me because I like a bit of char), but the inside ranged from well-cooked on the sides, to cold red center, which is not good. A well-cooked filet, ordered medium rare, is a cool pink throughout. What I also didn't like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plates, just because we split it. Well, it probably didn't get to cook enough since you cut the sucker open, and it got colder by the time you brought it to the table. \\n\\nWhat was good was that your entree comes with a small crock of mashed potatoes and roasted season vegetables, which was yummy. That's a nice addition, considering most steak places just give you a steak, a la carte. \\n\\nThey had forgotten the steamed broccolini and didn't bring it out until we asked for it. We had a wine from their seven for seven list, which was pretty good for $7. The ambience was very hotel/steakhouse-like.

I rather do a little work because crab legs is suppose to be eaten that way. They have very cheap food, such as fried rice, fried chicken, pizza, shrimp cocktail, meat, salads, and the like. Oh, forget about the sushi, they were so disgusting, they must be sitting there the whole day. One can tell by the rice being so dry that it falls off from the roll. I just don't understand how they can serve this stuff.\\n\\nThe deserts, however, were pretty good but unimaginative. On the bright side i do like their service. But, come on, for a 50 buffet this is such a rip off.", "My friend ordered chicken wings, when they arrived, the smell which quickly took over our senses was that of either\\nA) Fresh feces\\nB) Rotting dog carcass or\\nC) Satan's nutsack\\n\\nWe sent the wings back and tried to enjoy our meals.

When it was brought out, I noticed mango all over it. I told the waitress I was highly allergic to mango. I didn't want to send back the whole dish, so I kept the Ahi and asked her to bring me new greens. She had the audacity to charge me for a Salad! We even bought a bottle of wine and had our two kids with us. We didn't just order $40 which was what the Groupon was for. The food sucked too. Don't waste your money.\\n\\nIt seems others with a Groupon experiences the same type of awful service. Hmmm....

We were not impressed. My dish was just bad-- easily the worst Indian meal that I have ever had in my life. It tasted like there were no seasonings added (or at least not the right seasonings). It was just really really bland and not at all spicy. My husband thought his was okay (but said he would never go back), which is why I am rating this a 2 instead of a 1. The service was great, but the food was bad. I actually ate a few bites, asked for a to-go box, stopped by the store for spices and stuff to make a Masala sauce, and re-cooked my meal. \\n\\nThe na'an is not like na'an that I have had anywhere else, and not in a good way.

After about 20 mins of waiting and still no server, I had to get up and flag one over myself. She came over, took our order etc etc. After waiting an hour, yes an HOUR.. and not even our drinks had come out but yet seeing everyone else around us getting their food, I finally got up and asked her about our order in which she insisted that it would only take a few more minutes. Okay, understandable. Maybe they're a little backed up in the kitchen? Who knows. \\n\\nAnyway, after about 15 more mins of waiting she comes over to our table and says \\\"\"I'm sorry, but what did you guys order again?\\\"\" Uhhh are you kidding me??? I proceeded to tell her and she tells me to just come with her to the register where she puts in my lane number and come to find out there is NO order even inputted into the system under that lane. I asked her if my order was even put in and she assured me that it was and that somebody else probably took my food by mistake. She told me that it would only take 10 mins at the most and everything should be out. At this point, you can imagine how irritated I already am but I go back to my table anyway and continue to wait. Finally, about 15-20 mins later, the food comes out. I ordered the blt Cobb salad and she looks at me and says, \\\"\"oh, did you need silverware?\\\"\" Why of course not. I was actually planning on eating my salad with my fingers. Like really????? Took her another 5 mins to bring over the silverware and by this time, I honestly lost my appetite. \\n\\nI have never experienced such awful service before. For the amount of money I spent there today, I expected way more. That experience alone is enough to make me not return. \\n\\n\\n\\nBtw, the garlic fries are disgusting!

You expect the place to live up to the reputation you and your husband -- both Phoenix natives -- have heard about all your lives. You expect to be truly impressed. Unfortunately, were not.\\n\\nOur disappointment began at the get-go, with the less-than-friendly reception from our front desk clerk. No \\\"\"Hi, welcome to the Arizona Biltmore!\\\"\" No \\\"\"Thanks for staying with us.\\\"\" I don't think she even cracked a smile throughout the entire check-in process.\\n\\nOur disillusionment continued when we received our bill, which included a $28 \\\"\"resort fee.\\\"\" When we sought clarification, the front desk clerk (not  Miss Surly) sweetly explained it was a fee for hotel services, such as phone, Internet, the business center, shuttle, etc. - none of which we even used. Yet, we were expected to pay for them. I think the traditional pay-for-play method would be a whole lot more equitable.\\n\\nFinally, since I had about two hours to kill between check out and my next commitment, I inquired at the concierge desk if they had a small fridge where I could park my leftovers from the previous night's dinner while I shopped in the area. Grudgingly, the man behind the counter agreed to the request. A \\\"\"Sure, no problem!\\\"\" would have made it seem like much less of an imposition.\\n\\nBugged by the whole let-down, my husband called to report our observations about the storied Arizona Biltmore.

The food is no better, but the prices? Ouch!  This is a great place to go to show you don't care about the value of a product.  For example, a Caesar Salad is $15.  Is it better than the Caesar at Italian Village in Chicago?  Not even close IMHO.  The croutons were good though.\\n\\nI had the Spaghetti Bolognese upgraded to linguini with no problems.  It was a nice dish of pasta, not too large, but $28?  Not worth it at all; if it came in at around $12 at most, it would be acceptable.  So spending over $40 for a plate of pasta and a salad (no drinks) is unthinkable unless there is something magical about the food.  The only magic was the disappearance of my money.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we had a family platter of calamari with a few shrimp and a fillet of a white fish.  Great texture to the calamari, but I'm sure other restaurants can make the same quality for much less.  The meatballs in marinara sauce were really good, tender, flavourful and a nice size.\\n\\nIf this restaurant has some notoriety, it is not for the food.  Looks like the Wolf of Wall Street took a bite out of me...", "To start with, there is always a line and a wait to get in, even if half the restaurant is empty. You'd think this may be to take the time to clean tables, but unfortunately it isn't. I think they do it to make it look popular to people passing by. \\nBack to the cleanliness, or lack thereof - under the table was so dirty that we were accidental kicking debris on each other when simply shifting our feet around. So disgusting! At least they wiped the table and seats down just before we were seated, because hey, what's better than sitting on wet vinyl seats. By the way, there were still crumbs on the seat. \\nThe burgers consist of previously frozen patties that aren't very good and pretty decent veggies. Not really what you're looking for when you are dropping this much money on a burger. Just save some money and go up one floor to Mickey Ds. \\nTheir other food isn't a great value either. For example, $8 will get you 5 alright onion rings. Stay away from the shakes, unless you aren't picky. \\nService was very slow. Ambiance was kind of cool 50s diner, only with a very loud sound system. \\nWe felt like we were in a glorified karaoke bar with the waitresses making announcements and singing at odd times. \\nThere is no reason to visit this place.

We ordered the first round of sushi & rolls - which was fine. Then a couple more. Then we decided to ask the waiter for recommendations. We ordered some of the special rolls since our first round of sushi was mainly nigiri. Well, the waiter who brought our rolls brought the wrong rolls! & the original waiter LEFT FOR THE DAY. Wait, what?! I'm used to places introducing the second waiter or at least letting us know if they are taking a break or leaving. So, of course, we're telling this new waiter that the rolls he brought us are NOT the ones we ordered. He kept saying one was the lobster roll & we had a shrimp tempura roll - which was the same thing! So we had these two baked rolls (that were the same!) which are heavy, so of course we got full faster.

Other than the view, there really isn't much to see or do since it's geared towards tables and bottle service.  There's no cocktail list to speak of so you won't find anything resembling craft cocktails here.  Maybe it's more happening on the weekend, but I don't imagine it's that much better.

They are very slow with their service. The manager was not of any help. I complained about the bathrooms being very messy for a scottsdale bar. He blamed it on the amount of customers he had come through after a movie had let out.

The Famous cheesesteak at this location is hardly worthy of the name. At the Williams Field location you'll get a proper cheesesteak... 1000% better than here.", "After reading numerous reviews about their Biloxi fried chicken sandwich ($13) being described as \\\"\"Chick-fil-A on crack\\\"\", I was definitely intrigued. I'm an avid Chick-fil-A fan, and in fact, it is probably my fave fast food chain. Unfortunately, the closest location is in LA, but whenever we are in the area, we will make it a point to stop by.\\n\\nI have to vehemently disagree with the other reviews on this one. When I order a fried chicken sandwich, I expect a certain amount of crispy, crunchy texture. Honey Salt's rendition is more like a grilled chicken sandwich, albeit a decent one, and lacks sufficient fried goodness. In addition, the Durkee's dressing sauce was utterly forgettable. Not only are Chick-fil-A's chicken and selection of sauces vastly superior, but it's also a much better value. Alternatively, I'd rather get the southern fried chicken sandwich at the Cheesecake Factory across the street in Boca Park. The chopped salad that it comes with was an utter disappointment as well. It consisted of radishes, edamame, carrots, kale, pumpkin seeds, cubes of sharp cheddar cheese, and mixed greens. An interesting collection, but ultimately the flavors were neither harmonious nor enjoyable.\\n\\nThe blueberry pancakes with lemon curd ($13) had a nice, fluffy texture inside, but lacked any sort of exterior crispiness, the hallmark of a really good pancake.\\n\\nDessert was the highlight. Their triple layer cake ($9) was very interesting and tasty. It consisted of dense chocolate cake layered with fudge and banana cake with cardamom and coated with buttercream frosting. Although it is a bit pricey for the portion size and it could be more moist, this is the one item we would probably order again.\\n\\nAs for the service... let's start back at the beginning. After being seated, our server, Julie, asks us what kind of bottled water we want to drink. We decline and ask for tap water. She then asks if we would like to snack on some edamame while we peruse the menu. I'm thinking it is complimentary, ESPECIALLY since I do NOT see edamame listed ANYWHERE on the brunch menu, so we say okay. After we make our brunch selections, the bread basket comes out with some sort of bean dip. At first we are a bit confused. Is this what she meant by the edamame? Is this an edamame dip? If so, why isn't it green? BTW, the bread and lavosh was totally unremarkable. Several minutes later, we get the edamame sprinkled with some citrus zest. We end up adding some salt and pepper because it so bland. The shocker was when we get our bill and it shows we were charged $7 for edamame! We were both instantly infuriated. We wouldn't have ordered edamame to begin with and certainly not for $7! Not in the mood to argue with the server and/or manager, we tipped less than we normally would and even wrote a brief note why. We can tolerate slow, inattentive service to a certain degree, but not deception and trickery to run up the bill. As we looked around, we noted a few other tables who had said yes to the edamame as well. We found it odd that none of the other numerous Yelp reviews/tips mention the non-complimentary edamame.\\n\\nIn summary, the food itself rates about 3 stars. Deceptive, aggressive upcharging knocks it down to a 2-star experience overall.\\n\\nConsider yourself warned. JUST SAY NO TO THE EDAMAME! IT'S NOT COMPLIMENTARY AND DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $7!", "At a show now. The venue is top notch. The security is short tempered and on a power trip. We almost left because of the attitudes and confrontational demeanor. Other than the uptight personnel and cameras all over making you feel like a criminal, it's a nice place.

My wife and I used to come here every week until we moved further away for lunch and dinner. The food and service used to be great.  When we went back recently though, the service was horrible.  It wasnt even busy, but the staff had changed and we werent even greeted by the door and had to stand and look for awhile.  When we were finally seated, the plates that came out  were extremly dirty with food marks still on them.  Even one of the utensils had stuff on it.  My wife asked a waitress which was really unfriendly about the plates and spoon.  The thai waitress just laughed, grabbed all of it and left without saying a word or apology.  We were like \\\"\"WHAT THE @@@@!  \\\"\" Some of the appetizers had changed and the food had obviously gone downhill.

Several people affiliated with the conference warned they, their family members, or friends had gotten bed bugs while staying at the Riviera. Because the conference we were in Vegas to attend was being held there, my colleague and I decided to press our luck and stay there for convenience.\\n\\nI've decided to write a simple account of my experience in chronological order. \\n\\n1) When I went to check in, I attempted to redeem a voucher for a free room upgrade. Surprise! The room was already booked and they had only rooms left with king-sized beds. No offense fo my colleague, but we preferred to have our own beds. Sounded like the Twitter deal was a scam. The real offense? The check-in clerk was incredibly rude. I was astounded. \\n\\n2) We got bedbugs. Yep. It happened. I have pictures. When we brought this to the front desk's attention a manager came out, hurried us into a corner, told us security would meet us up at the room to investigate. We protested, he insisted. We went up to the room where a security officer met us. He took pictures of the bites, wrote something down and keyed up his radio, \\\"\"Code green, that's a positive.\\\"\" I rolled my eyes. He took his flashlight and peered under the top cover. \\\"\"I don't see any bedbugs.\\\"\" \\n\\nBedbugs infest the corners of mattresses. They get in the little seams. They crawl on the top of picture frames. Alongside the corners of the carpet. I couldn't believe it. We protested and he called his supervisor. \\n\\nThis huge guy came into the room and we explained how impossible it was to conclude there were no bedbugs after such a cursory check. We said we didn't want to pay for the room. He said that the management would take care of everything and escorted us back to the manager. \\n\\nThe manager told us there was nothing he could do except change our rooms. He told us security have their procedures and are trained (to be useless, for sure). We protested. He gave us a card and said loss prevention would contact us in 7-10 days. That was on the 14th of March. Today is March 29th; I've heard nothing. We told him the security guy said management would take care of us. He said there was nothing he could do. As a result of their incompetence, we missed dinner with our colleagues. They did give us, after my roommate got upset, a voucher for dinner. \\n\\n3) When we went to check out, we asked right away to speak with a manager. A different manager than the previous night appeared, and when we said we got bedbugs she hurried us away from the other folks checking out. We told her we didn't want to pay for the room. She said there was nothing she could do--loss prevention would contact us. We said she was the manager--she could do anything she wanted. I said, \\\"\"I've read many reviews on various travel sites that have claimed loss prevention never contacts them after they get bed bugs.\\\"\" She got upset and said, \\\"\"Why would you go and read those sites!\\\"\" I laughed and said, I'm happy to show the folks in line my bites. Then she called security. \\n\\n4) Security came and mocked us and threatened us. We said we were here with the teacher's conference, and one guard got angry and said angrily, \\\"\"What kind of teachers do you think you are?\\\"\" They circled us as my roommate continued talking to the manager. I told them to get out of my personal space and asked folks who were checking out to witness their hostility. They got in my face and I started taking pictures. I have several. I started tweeting everything. That's when they backed off and left. \\n\\nNow, you can make your own decision to stay here. My roommate and I have not yet been contacted by the hotel about getting bed bugs. \\n\\nThe managers at this hotel had total control over our experience as guests, and they chose not to compensate us adequately, the hotel security insulted and threatened us, and there has been no follow up. \\n\\nChoose where you stay wisely.", "Took a chance on this place because Pho 87 was closed.

A lady came from the back to inform us that there was a half hour wait for a table. We were a little confused, since there were sooo many tables open, but said of course we could wait. She looked REALLY put out that we chose to wait, even though it was 2 hours before closing. The server sat us in a booth, and asked us if we would like some water. We asked if we could have a coke?

She actually grabbed a sign that was facing away from us and showed it to us; it said that it takes a half hour for food to be ready. Then she said, \\\"\"and I told you it was a half hour wait to get a table.\\\"\" We were shocked. We had already been there nearly an hour and a half, and while definitely put out, we hadn't even complained.

I understand that they may be understaffed, but how is it customer service to behave as we are being unreasonable because we have been waiting an hour and a half and want to take our food to go? The showing us the sign was a huge insult. I know how to tell time. I knew exactly how long we had been there. Good customer service is apologizing for the wait and giving a good excuse for it. The kitchen being a half hour backed up is no excuse for it being 1 hr 45 mins before our food arrived.\\n\\nWe never got the salad. It wasn't in the to-go food. I cannot recommend this restaurant.

They were charging a ridiculous $12 for rubbery whatever that was, cold eggs, rock hard pancakes and a tiny dish of grapes served by a lady who couldn't even tell me the price of the brunch.

Adding Madison's Francesca's to the skip it list.", "I am a high traffic traveler.  I am at Sky Harbor once or twice a week.  I know every restaurant option and even the servers and TSA agents because of my frequency.  If you are eating in the \\\"\"high A\\\"\" terminal (gates 20+), this is really your only sit down option.  It's OK food, but the breakfast sucks.   \\n\\nThere are a couple of issues I have with this restaurant.  1) When you sit down and order, they want you to pay in advance.  I ordered a food and drink and they asked to run my credit card.  That's just bad form.  We're in an airport.  If people are stiffing you, hire more people or people who are more attentive.  2) At the food prep station, next to the kitchen, there appears to be a large amount of bored employees chatting it up.  They are loud and obnoxious.  No one really cares to hear about their prior night's excursion - all while I have an Ice Tea with no sweetener (how hard is it to bring sweetener with tea?), or when my food comes, no one bothered to give me my set up.  Why don't they all just STFU and focus on the customer? How about using some of those people to watch out for the dine-n-dash people, so you don't run my credit card when I sit down?  3) The food is just unremarkable, considering the way Sky Harbor has stepped up the food options with Sauce, Chelsea's Kitchen and the like.  \\nThis joint is way better than Cinnabon or Burger King, but it still falls to the bottom.  I would rather have Blue Burrito back, which this place took over.  \\n\\n If you're there for breakfast, I have tried them all and they really aren't good.  My breakfast item comes from the \\\"\"all day\\\"\" menu. Ask for the quesadilla with ground beef and cheese.  Also ask for extra salsa, since they restrict how much salsa they give out.  They provide you one little plastic side cup, that's only filled  1/2 way. The quesadilla will be a little greasy with the cheese/meat, but it's edible and tastes good. \\nI like Cowboy Ciao but you need to walk all the way over to B terminal.  A terminal has Blanco Tacos.  If you're at Sky Harbor early enough, it's worth the walk for either of these options, and the walk will do you good to and fro!", "Just going to copy verbatim what I composed in an email. \\nDear Brandon,\\nI was a patron on Saturday February 15 at approximately 10:30 PM at your Trevi restaurant. I wanted to advise you of some good and not so good observations that I feel I should bring to your attention. \\nOur waiter Joey was excellent. He was prompt and catered to my party of 8 with great care and hospitality. \\n\\nContrarily, I observed one of the kitchen staff place an order of chicken Ceaser salad  on the table in a not so flattering way. Best description is that it was just tossed on the table without a care. Sorry, I had no name to provide only that he and another colleague were amused at the action. \\nAlso I and another in my party ordered one of the specials. Swordfish. It was cold and Joey immediately retuned it to the kitchen for a quick microwave. Still I was disappointed that it arrived in that state. \\nOtherwise all the food orders were enjoyed by all.", "Not sure what they are serving here but being from Texas I wouldn't call this barbecue.  The pulled pork is very light on smoke flavor and our pork had no bark at all.  A sure sign of short cut smoking procedures.  The \\\"\"brisket\\\"\" was a cut I have never seen before.  More of a roast cut.  The brisket got its flavor from a brine that the meat was swimming in.  \\n\\nService was slooooow.  We waited almost an hour on a Tuesday for our meals.  Why?  This stuff is already cooked!   Come on.  Throw it on a plate and roll it out.  \\n\\nOur waitress seemed bothered to have to wait on us on a TUESDAY.  There might have been 15 people in the place tops. \\n\\nThis was my one and only trip to this \\\"\"BBQ\\\"\" establishment.", "Arriving in PHX at 9 pm we made our way to the rental car area. There were about 10 people ahead of us in line. We waited in line for over an hour and I'm pretty sure that the lone guy behind the counter  helped one person in that time. I finally gave up and went over to a bigger name rental company where the guy matched fox's price and had me checked out and in my car in about 10 minutes. Save yourself the hassle and headache and go through a reputable rental company", "I received a flyer in the mail for a good deal on brake service from Infiniti of Peoria. I'm not much for handing off my car to others and do most of my own maintenance, but I thought the deal was decent plus I wanted to give some local guys a fair shake.\\n\\nI had the rear brake pads replaced and the rotors machined for $200 and an alignment for $99. They were also kind enough to do a 31 point inspection just for kicks. It's the inspection report that I find difficult to chew on.\\n\\nThe following are a few quotes from the dealer provided report:\\n\\nObservation: Found cabin/Hepa micro filter dirty\\nRecommendation: Replace cabin/HEPA micro filter\\n\\nObservation: Found automatic transmission fluid to be contaminated/burnt\\nRecommendation: Perform automatic transmission fluid exchange service\\n\\nObservation: Found coolant to be in poor condition or contaminated\\nRecommendation: Perform coolant fluid exchange service\\n\\nObservation: Found rear differential fluid to be dirty/contaminated\\nRecommendation: Perform rear differential service\\n\\nThese were just a few observations from the report. Just over $500 bucks for these services. Actually, all of the report observations and services totaled over $3000.\\n\\nThe rub: as mentioned above, I do much of my own work on the car. Just a few weeks earlier, for example, I had replaced the HEPA filter myself and it was essentially brand new. Dirty automatic transmission fluid? Well the car has a manual transmission and I serviced it in the recent past with synthetic gear oil and at the same time serviced the rear differential with the same brand synthetic. When I replaced the gear oil in the transmission and differential, I was pleased to see how clear and clean it was. I also replaced the crush washers as per the FSM. Poor condition or contaminated coolant? The coolant was replaced in the recent past as I had to replace a faulty thermostat.\\n\\nEthically challenged tactics to say the least.  Beware the fact that they really don't perform inspections.", "I was disappointed when I initially went to the Henderson location, looking for good BBQ, only to see that they had discontinued that portion of their menu.  So I trekked all the way to this location only to find out why it wasn't very popular in the first place...\\n\\nI got the cowboy plate with choice of three meats, so I wouldn't have to come back and sample anything:\\n\\n1) The beef brisket was awful.  Hard and chewy.  Even though it was sliced thin, it somehow managed to resemble rubber.\\n\\n2) The pork brisket tasted bad.  I don't know whether it was the sauce or the leftover pork they selected to make this.  Yuck.\\n\\n3) The pork ribs were of the sparerib variety, which means it was full of meat but kind of tough and dry.  Definitely the star of the show, but I wouldn't call it the best by any stretch of the imagination.\\n\\nSo there we go.  Some of the worst BBQ I've tried in Vegas, and believe me, I've tried it all.  Never again.\\n\\nIf you do come here, stick with something simple like the wings...which still kind of taste dry, but at least they have the BBQ flavoring to them.", "i find this store creepy. it seems like the perfect place to witness the absolute worst side of human behavior (after violent riots and genocide, I mean). Any store that has a disclaimer sign out front, sternly warning customers not to run, shove, or steal from each other's carts, gets struck off my regular shopping list. You'd think those rules are just common decency, but apparently not at Last Chance.", "My wife and I went to the SOUTH SIDE location last night looking forward to the Wednesday Happy Hour special of $1 oysters.  We got there at 6, went in and grabbed 2 seats at the bar.  The bar was reasonably busy but the restaurant was dead.  \\n\\nThe bartender immediately came over offering drinks.  We ordered 2 draft beers and asked about the Happy Hour menu.  She acted almost turned off when she realized we were only there for HH.  We ordered Bruschetta for $2.95, Mussels for $4.95 and a plate of 10 oysters- 5 Blue Points and 5 Choptank.  \\n\\nThe food came out nice & quick and we were set.  The Blue Points were big, meaty, sweet & delicious.  The Choptanks were small but still tasty.  The Bruschetta was a bit confusing with diced tomatoes mixed in with halved cherry tomatoes.  It proved a feat just to keep it on the baguette slices.  The Mussels were more of a 'small plate' than a full order and they were boring and bland- cooked in butter & garlic.  With all the better restaurants going to fancier more complex tasting but just as simple dishes- we were not impressed.         \\n\\nNoticing my beer was empty, the batender offered another.  She was quick to offer drinks at the bar... but as we looked around we noticed just about every other table in the bar area loaded with empty glasses and patrons all seeming like they were ready for more.  There was a stretch of about 20 minutes where not a single server came around to check on those tables.  Thank god we got seats at the bar.  We couldn't tell if it was the bartender's job to wait those tables or not, but we couldn't tell who was responsible for this area and it was definitely neglected.  \\n\\nOur plates were empty but the Blue Points were so good I was going to order 10 more- when I find good seafood I usually go for seconds...  But 10 minutes go by and our empty plates are still in front of us, I decided to just interrupt the bartender and pay our 'passage'.  \\n\\nWe would go back... but we learned our lesson- get seats at the bar, order drinks and all the oysters we're going to eat, then leave.  Don't expect good service, cause you're not going to find it here at the bar.  \\n\\nD&K", "I was in Las Vegas for a trip in the month of august with my friends.\\nThe lunch buffet was about to close in 30 minutes when we walked in and i felt we were late for the lunch. The ambiance was ok and staff paid attention when we walked inside. The owner of the restaurant was also working along with restaurant staff. They have very limited number of items for the lunch buffet. The food in the containers was about to finish and we asked the waitress to get the food. I liked the curry with boiled eggs and it was perfect combination with Naan's. The food is not so spicy and the price of the buffet was ok.

The people who run the place are friendly and very nice.\\n\\nI went there because I was given a pack of courses as a gift. The only time I could go was on Wednesday evening and that's when they have the Yoga Foundations classes. The type of yoga was challenging and quite frankly, was awkward at times. We were instructed to build complex setups with blocks and chairs and cushions on top of which we had to lie and keep a difficult pose for a long period. Everyone had trouble getting set up and we spent more time getting ready than doing the actual poses. Finally, everyone ended up having numb legs and feet and our knees would hurt from sitting on our knees for too long. And often, the postures using the chairs left us with a lot of back an neck pain. Especially those where we had to do awkward inversions. I am very sceptical about how beneficial that was as the next day my spine would hurt in a couple of areas and a bad headache from the muscle pain in my shoulders and neck.\\n\\nI don't know about the other classes, but I wouldn't recommend doing the Yoga Foundations classes, especially if you have back problems.\\n\\nOther than that, like I said, I've only attended that one kind of class so I can't say what the other ones are like. And the people were nice too.", "They were quick and they are nice people but their prices suck.

We really like several hence the large order and felt he was not allowing us the proper time to choose...you would think he would spend what ever time necessary our order was a good size one BUT NOOOO ...he was still rushing us to the point I asked him if he needed to be somewhere...I asked him if there was a reason he was rushing us. It was to the point that we picked all the pics and I only bought a group photo telling him I needed to come back. If I did not like the pictures that were taken I would not have given him my money. As a business owner he should have been more patient with us. I actually had to think on this one long and hard especially when I found out the clerk was not a clerk but the owner.

I needed a quick wash on my SUV, and requested an exterior-only wash that had been done for me at Ray Rd.  They stated it was no longer on the menu and I would need to purchase the regular wash instead for twice the price.  They also grilled me about getting my car detailed because they were running a \\\"\"special\\\"\", which turned out to be their normal price.  When I went to the counter to pay, my receipt stated that I could return within a few days and receive an exterior-only wash for half the price of my regular wash!  I informed the cashier that I was told that it was no longer on the menu, and she said that wasn't true and that they still do them. :-(\\n\\nFast forward to yesterday... I pulled into the drive lines and asked for an exterior-only wash, and the man (a different one than before) became very confrontational with me telling me that they no longer do them and I would need to pay for the regular wash.  I explained that I did not need anything done on the inside, and that the cashier said the exterior-only was still on the menu.  He started yelling at me, saying she was wrong and she didn't know what she was talking about.  I didn't want to argue with him as I was holding up the line, so I agreed to the regular wash, AGAIN.  \\n\\nI understand that businesses are still struggling, but the way to succeed is to accommodate your customers and keep your policies consistent, not confront your way into selling a more expensive service.

I get nervous about finding a trustworthy dry cleaner that will do a good job. I do like that they do it on house too. So far, I would highly recommend checking this place out.

But no big deal, hey I am not crying over half a cup of soup, just seems to me if there is one table in the whole place you might want to go the extra mile. \\n\\nMy main issue: I ordered kung pao chicken no chicken, baby corn instead of chicken. I order this at every chinese restaurant I go to, and rarely have an issue. I had a whole conversation with the dude about meat, that I wouldnt mind paying extra, I just prefer x veggies instead of chicken, mainly corn. \\n\\nI get my order and it is tied in a knot to where I cant open the bag without ripping the whole bag open. I get home and open my box....to Kung Pao Zucchini. I mean literally, it is ALL zucchini with TWO bites of carrot and three (no seriously, three) water chestnuts and zero baby corn. WTH?\\n\\nSo I call and talk to the dude, and ask him what gives? I mean, I like zucchini as much as the next person but really? He says oh, there are carrots in there too, to which i let him know there was two bites. I asked where the corn was, I mean we had this whole conversation..\\\"\"Oh, I wasn't really paying attention to all that. Do you want to come back for another one?\\\"\"  Ahh no, it is over 100 degrees out and I just finally got home with my messed up food, no I will not be driving back. Ever. \\n\\nMy boyfriends bourbon chicken was ok, he didn't care for the chow mein or rice so we just threw that away.\\n\\nSo yeah, I gave them a benefit star for having big portions and good prices.

The coupon was for buy one race get the second one free, but the girl behind the counter says its for buy two races get the third one free.  So after a little argument my wife gives in and buys the races.  After a little thought she goes back to speak to a manager and she gets some guy behind the counter and he says that it actually was buy one get one free.  But he cannot refund my wife for a race because my son was already on his third race, so instead he gives us a voucher for a free race, which i thought was pretty good but would rather have the money.  There were two other girls behind the counter who were bad at customer service, plus my wife her them talking about her in the back office and one of the girls was the owners daughter.  \\n\\nAs for the track and carts they were alright but the staff can regulate the speed because the carts are electric.

They needed to either be honey-roasted or salted. The rotisserie chicken was very dry. The outside skin was good but not as tasty as their sister location's. Still, the accompanying sauces helped boost the missing flavor, but didn't help with the lack of juiciness goodness. Spicy beans were a huge improvement over the other joint's black beans, but I didn't care for the cilantro rice. I really wish they would work on both rices.

I had the baby back ribs, my wife had the half-and-half, and my nephew had the pulled pork.  My baby back ribs were just ok, and the only sauces they make are a little out of the ordinary, yet tasty.  My complaints were in the general quality of the meats, and the tenderness of the meats were lacking.  We all commented that the ribs (which should be fall off the bone or at least very tender) were something that required a knife.  The sauces, (which I'm used to mild, medium, hot, etc.) were a lineup of sweet-hot, regular and regular flavored with cajun seasoning.  This didn't appear to be a good lineup for me as I favor really hot spicy BBQ sauces (and I don't like \\\"\"sweet\\\"\"), like the kind Westport BBQ would provide in KC.

There is an ethernet cable that you can hook to your laptop which is an amenity included in your resort fee.

The polish job wasn't the greatest. I ended up with some sloppiness around the edges. The gal (not the same gal doing my pedi) offered to do a chevron design on my nails which I wanted, but when it came to it she wasn't able to do it. I ended up with a flower design instead. It's cute and all, but flower designs are a little played out. This was my first gel mani but I felt like my hands spent entirely too much time under the UV lights.

I told her I had washed them before I had brought them to her since being a shorter guy I have done this for years with other alterations and knew the routine.   At 1st I was honestly not even that upset about the wrong alterations but after she kept, basically, calling me a liar by insisting I had washed them I started to get upset.

A few months ago, my fiance and I stopped into the store to get an idea on a suit for me for our up coming wedding.  We first met the son, who was very nice and knowledgeable.  I recently returned to the shop when it was time to finally purchase a suit as our wedding is getting close.  I was helped by Maragita, and sold a nice suit. She initially gave me a good deal, and I felt satisfied with the experience.  LET ME TELL YOU HOW THINGS CHANGED ONCE THEY'VE GOT YOUR MONEY!!!!! The suite was ordered from the manufacturer, and arrived about ten days later. When I went to pick it up, I tried it on for any necessary alterations.  I was quoted an extra $115 to make it fit.  Now I understand all suits need some alterations, but this was major work needed.  I took the suit, to get some comparison quotes to fit it, which were cheaper.  I decided to return to the shop to see if the would work with me in coming to an arrangement since I was not happy with the way the experience was going.  A $200 suit, now was costing me $315, when i was under the impression that any alterations were included.  I expressed my displeasure with Margarita, who became very defensive.  I explained that I felt lead a stray in buying the suit since I tried the pants on in front of her and she knew how much alterations the would need.  I understand that alterations are time consuming and people aren't going to work for free.   I suggested a 50% discount and offered to pay $65, to meet me in the middle.  She did not accept this, and was unwilling to work with me at all in satisfying my displeasure.  She even had the attitude that it was some how my fault for not knowing how these things work.  I informed her that she wasn't really doing much to keep me business, and she stated that she had many happy customers and didn't need my return business.

I recently came back from my Vegas vacation with my boyfriend. We stayed just couple blocks away from this Tropicana location, and I thought it was very convenient, within a walking distance, etc. My boyfriend wasnt a member of 24 hr. so I added him to my membership using their family add-on plan. One of the managers then mentioned that I qualify for a personal training session, as I added a new member, which I thought was an attractive offer; she also asked me whether I would like to do a weights session, a functional training, or something else. I said lets do a functional training since I wanted to try something new besides lifting and yoga, both of which I do 5 to 6 days a week.\\nShe scheduled me with one of their trainers, Dina B. Now, on the day of our supposedly functional training session, she did an assessment meet up instead (which I didnt ask for, as I know where I stand), by basically pointing out that my body fat percentage is very high (btw I am 5'8 and 131 pnds), that I look athletic but Im actually not, and pretty much tried to sell me personal training sessions during the 45 minutes we spend in the office! When I made it clear that buying a personal training is not one of my priorities at this time, I got \\\"\"nice to meet you!\\\"\" with a handshake, and that was it! The last 15 minutes out of that *are you done bullshitting me* hour didnt even seem to exist, although in my opinion could at least be used to talk about nutrition, supplements, etc.\\nI would call it dysfunctional bullshit, and a terrible customer service. After this so-called \\\"\"functional training\\\"\" neither one of the managers nor a person at the front desk asked me about my experience or how I felt about that hour I wasted in their office being pushed to purchase the personal training sessions, whereas I could spend that time to do an actual workout. \\nAll I got to hear is the trainer's bragging about her personal achievements, and how apparently out of shape I am.\\nSo, if you are offered a complimentary personal session, especially with Dina B. at this Tropicana location, just say No, thanks! dont waste your time and just stick with your workout plan and your goals.

Time kept ticking. \\n\\nFinally, we asked about our order and when it would be ready. Guy at the window looked at his tickets and did not have ours. Perhaps ours had been the order that we had seen him throw away earlier? Or, maybe the person who took our order never put it in the right spot? Either way, he was rude about it and wanted our ticket, which we gave to him. Next, he went back to the frozen drink that he started to make earlier and gave it to us.

The lady checking me out was super sweet, my pizzas were ready when I came to pick them up. The place looked really cool inside, there were parking spots dedicated for people picking up pizzas. Neither the gluten free or the regular crust pizzas, unfortunately, tasted good - bland, hard crust and little flavor.

I felt like if I stuck some on my arm, it would be absorbed by my skin and instantly turned into fat and an artery clog. \\n\\nLet me back up though - the parking lot is a crowded mess where you can pretty much assume your car is going to get dented by another car door. How about some wider spaces and one person has to park on the street? After that, you walk into a dark dungeon where a 9 month pregnant girl directs you through some sort of dark bar into some hideously decorated brighter room with booths stolen from an IHOP that burned down in the 80s. \\n\\nThe table and seats were filthy and greasy and if someone sits behind you, you share opposite sides of a seatback - which is a little too intimate for me... \\n\\nThe margaritas are small and not very powerful or particularly tasty or memorable.

We wanted to stay somewhere downtown, park the car and enjoy the Fremont Street attractions on foot. We chose the Plaza for its location and price: big mistake.\\n\\nThe warning signs were there early, starting with the disgusting garage. We checked in, and while I had ordered a non-smoking room, we were told that only smoking rooms were available. The elevator groaned and squealed as we went up, before shuddering and shaking to a stop at my floor. I opened my door and was greeted with an unspeakably awful smell, like a mixture of cigarette butts, vomit and Lysol. I flicked on the light switch, but the room remained dark. As I entered, my foot hit something metal and sent it flying across the room. (This turned out to be a large steel kickplate from a vacuum cleaner.)\\n\\nI groped around the room until I found the bathroom, and turned on the light. As the fluorescent fixtures flickered and buzzed to life, I found myself wishing it was still dark. Now I've traveled all over the world, including third world regions of Asia and central America, but I've never been in a hotel room as disgusting as this. The wallpaper was deep yellow with cigarette smoke, and was peeling up at every seam. The bathroom tile was moldy and cracked and the toilet seat had a two inch cigarette burn. The carpet was so dirty you could barely see the pattern through the wide variety of dark mysterious stains. Everything in the room (lamps, phone TV remote, table) was sticky with gooey residue, and I desperately hoped it wasn't some kind of bodily fluid. I opened the window to try to air out the foul stench, but it only hinged open a few inches.\\n\\nI immediately called another hotel (The Golden Nugget) to make new accomodations. Sadly, nothing was available for that night so I had to bed down for one night at the Plaza. I used toilet paper (there was no box of tissues provided) to grab and toss the DNA encrusted bedspread into the corner, and pulled back the covers. The sheets themselves (miraculously) seemed clean, so I settled in for the night and tried to ignore the awful smell. The bed itself was rock-hard, and had a strange crunchy feel and sound, as though the mattress contained a layer of pebbles. (This was probably dried out, crunchy foam rubber.) I tried to not think about the pillow, and the variety of mites and pathogens it surely contained.\\n\\nIn the morning, I had a headache and sore throat, from inhaling that smell all night. I wanted out of there IMMEDIATELY, so I hopped in the shower. Wonderful, no hot water!!! The faucet at the sink worked OK, so clearly the shower valve was defective. After my ice water shower, there was no way I would walk around on that vile carpet, so I wrapped hand towels around my feet and shuffled around as I shaved and dressed.\\n\\nSeriously people, this joint is disgusting beyond belief, a wretched petri dish of filth.

My nail tech was very polite and all seemed to go well until the next day.  I had a gel coating put on my nails (red of course!) and it began peeling off my nails.  My Saturday, less than 48 hours later, six of my nails looked bad, almost without polish at all.  I called the shop Saturday morning and talked with Tim, the owner.  He gave me another number to call for an appointment which I made for 2 pm.  I arrive promptly after a thirty minute drive from my home (this is close to work).  I sat on the sofa for thirty minutes when Tim's wife approached me and said they would only fix two of my nails.  I told her they all needed the gel taken off and redone.  She said they only booked a half hour for me for a redo.  I did not need a fill, just new gel.  They wanted me to reschedule or wait another hour.  I explained I had an appoitment and drove 30 minutes.   \\nNow things got really wierd.  The wife sent me down to the other salon where the husband was.  I sat there another 5 minutes and realized I left my car key laying on the table in front of the sofa.   I went back and it was gone so asked the desk and she said no one turned it in.  A young girl was sitting there and said a woman picked it up and it was the owner's wife.  I approached her and asked for my key, she insisted it was her key.  I then walked down to the husband's salan again and explained I would have to phone the police because my key had been taken and someone obviously has it.  Tim went back to the other shop and miraculously my key appeared.  I left without having my nails repaired.  I will never walk into this shop again.  I see many customers are happy but I am sure they have not tried to get things redone due to their service before.  I was in the salon one hour and did not get one nail repaired.

I filled out this patient satisfaction survey and was contacted by Arcadia a day later. Arcadia offered me a second visit at the $40 introductory price. I accepted.\\n\\n6 months later I come to my appointment, having forgotten about the \\\"\"deal\\\"\" I was offered. I explained to the manager who greeted me that I was here for a free cleaning. She immediately, and rather rudely and bluntly, corrected my error. \\\"\"I'm the manager here, and I would never approve a free cleaning!\\\"\" she snapped at me. I apologized and said I might have been mistaken, that perhaps she could check my file. She did and discovered my offer had been $40. She also made the point to me that, \\\"\"the dentist and hygienist from your last visit are no longer with us,\\\"\" presumably to comfort me.\\n\\nI proceeded with my cleaning. Before the cleaning officially began my hygienist, Ms. Briggs, gave me a minute or so pitch on why I should buy a Sonicare from their office. When I mentioned buying it off Amazon, she stressed that if I purchased it from their office, I would receive a 2-year warranty, and that their Sonicare was the newer version, as opposed to Costco. It is a weird feeling to have to turn down a saleswoman who is inevitably going to be cleaning your mouth for the next 45-minutes. Your dentist's office shouldn't be pushing Sonicares like a street vendor. If you want to offer them, that's fine, but it shouldn't require a patient to have to (multiple times) turn down your sales pitch. After I turned her down I then spent the next 45 minutes dealing with one of the most painful cleanings I've ever had. When I was done Ms. Briggs informed me that I should expect to be \\\"\"sore\\\"\" tomorrow because of how bad my gums were. Every time I spit, for about an hour after, my spit was rust colored from blood.\\n\\nI'm 31 years old. I've gone to two other dentists for the duration of my life, one of whom, Dr. Michael J. Cooley of Chandler, is rated as a top Arizona dentist. I tried Arcadia because it's next to my new office. With that being said, I've never had a cleaning that was anywhere near as painful as what I received, nor have I ever had a hygienist tell me I was going to be sore for the next few days, nor have I ever been spitting blood out for hours. Ms. Briggs then, at the conclusion of my cleaning, informed me she'd like to schedule my next appointment in \\\"\"4 months\\\"\" because that was how bad the situation in my mouth apparently was. Again, not one dentist or hygienist has ever, in my entire life, ever recommended I come every 4 months.\\n\\nThe conclusion I've reached: Arcadia \\\"\"Modern\\\"\" Dentistry is in fact very modern, if we assume that \\\"\"modern\\\"\" means focusing more on profits than people, firing dentists and hygienists because they're just cogs in the profit-making apparatus, attempting to get you to come 3 times a year to boost their profits, and trying to make a hard-sell on Sonicare's as you're propped back in a chair with a bib on. I'm going back to my old dentist. Sure he's not close to my work, but his office isn't owned by some corporation. It's just him and his name is on the door. If the future of dentistry is making the experience of going to the dentist like buying a car or life-insurance, I'll take the old-fashioned approach over Arcadia's \\\"\"Modern\\\"\" dentistry any day of the week.\\n\\nUPDATE: Upon posting my review I was contacted by Arcadia Modern Dentistry the next day. They told me they saw my Yelp review, were sorry I felt the way I did, and would be refunding my $40 cleaning fee. They assured me my feelings concerning their business practices are not accurate. I do appreciate that they reached out to me.", "DeLuca's does a relatively expensive breakfast, much like Pamela's and Square Cafe.

Waitress serving tables at the bar was extremely annoyed and outright rude to us as it was implied that we were in her way repeatedly. Poor bar design is not the customers fault. The area is narrow and not suited to have easy access by servers. Also, the rest of the more accessible tables in the restaurant were empty, as it was barely 5:30. Manager came over to ask us to move later, and was also extremely rude and could use a lesson in customer service. A simple, \\\"\"Here group of 10 enjoying drinks at our bar, we want to make room for you over here\\\"\", would have done nicely.\\n\\n2. A week later, another group of mine go to enjoy appetizers and drinks before dinner. We order the Paul Hobs 2007 Pinot Noir, they arrive and open a 2012. Upon realizing the error, we politely ask why the wrong wine was given, and also ask to just have the price of the 2012 vintage reflected on the bill. 1st response was, \\\"\"the bar manager said they are the same price\\\"\". When we ask to see the manager, we are promptly ignored on the issue for the rest of our visit.\\n\\nSuffice to say, inadequate service for a place which had great potential. Keep it up and you'll be closed before you can pay for the fancy decor and renovations.", "This place seems like it is under new management.  I went there many times in the past it was above average but now it is below average and was a great disappointment.  Service was poor.  Counters were dirty.  Personnel were unpleasant.

Excited to see that they offered a buffalo burger but was disappointed when all I tasted was the blue cheese slathered on it.

I responded that I had never heard of this, eventually she slinked away for 5 minutes and still came back with no answer. \\n\\nAnantuni's demeanor was no better. No explanation of what was happening to me was given. Both Anantuni & Sandi periodically  paused to stare blankly at the TV playing Good Morning America while working on me, which I found DISTURBING.

Ironically she was training another assistant on how to gag people using the same technique.  \\n\\nI was offended nearly to the point of tears during the first appointment.

It took about 15 minutes for the order to be fixed, and again a different waitress brought it out. Our original waitress did come back once and fill two of our drinks and then seemed to disappear. We finished eating at 4:30, and made it noticeable that we were done. I did see our waitress a few times, but she blatantly ignored our table and stayed mainly in the bar area. At 5:00 I flagged down a waiter and asked for our checks since our waitress hadn't been seen, he removed some of our plates and said he'd find her. We finally got our checks at 5:20, almost an hour after we had finished eating. We waited for a few minutes for her to come back and take our money but when she didn't return we left cash on the table and left. \\n\\nNone of us liked doing that and we are all appreciative of good service and tip well, but this was the worst service at a bar I had ever had. \\n\\nThe food was good, I had a chicken gyro and fries, others had the wings, nachos, or burgers, and we all enjoyed our meals even though they were a bit pricy. I think I'd almost rather have a lackluster meal with good service than an enjoyable meal with bad service. The atmosphere was good, the music was a bit loud but I am not a big fan of loud music while eating so that could just be me being picky. \\n\\nI won't be returning to Mullen's unless I see it on an episode of Restaurant Stakeout first.", "For a place that says they deliver their delivery radius is very small.

Sadly I left hungry with an upset stomach over the foods I tried. I started with some sushi that sort of looked dried out and when I tried a piece the rice wasn't seasoned and was just gooey and fell apart.I was hoping for some tasty seafood since this is a seafood buffet. I\\\"\"m not sure I did SEE FOOD but I saw cod and what they called salmon that was a white flesh fish here. I really like fish and I wasn't able to eat either of them the taste was too offensive. I put some vegetables on my plate but the broccoli was mushy and had a strange taste to it. \\n\\nSince I still didn't eat almost anything I decided to try the Mongolian stir fry. I picked some vegetables that looked good and some chicken. The stir fry guy asked me if I wanted teriyaki or soy sauce so I picked soy sauce. He chopped, he slopped sauced it up a bit and he twirled the spatula around a bit for show. It looked OK to me but it tasted awful like an 8 year old made it. The chicken was extremely dry I couldn't eat it but the way it tasted was just awful like all just soy sauce.\\n\\n They had one salad that wasn't completely awful but it tasted like old fish, it was the seaweed with cucumbers and radish. I was able to pull out the radishes and eat the radishes but the rest tasted very fishy.\\n\\nThe chicken on a stick was sweet and weird tasting. (YUK)\\n\\nMy husband tried to eat an octopus and he said it was just like rubber.\\n\\nThey didn't have much in the way of prepared stir fry dishes.\\n\\nI tried a piece of battered chicken that was OK and a couple of cold french fried that were edible.\\n\\nI did like the bean paste stuffed bun that looked like a peach. \\n\\nThe fresh grapes were very good.\\n\\nI saw loquats so I took some. I popped one in my mouth and had to spit it out because it tasted like something meaty was on it.\\n \\nThey just opened maybe they will get better and just don't have it together yet?\\n\\nI also note I didn't try everything so MAYBE they had some good dishes? I didn't try?\\nHowever I will never return.\\n\\nAs only a slight update This Buffet was featured on 5-16-13 on Dirty Dining with 11 major health code violations.

After being glared for being so inconsiderate as to want to pay for my purchases every time I use a human-staffed checkout lane, I gave up and will now use the self checkout even if the line is four deep and there are immediately available checkers.  The fact that the chain has a de facto monopoly is the only thing that permits such unpleasant experiences to be the standard here. \\n\\nOn top of the standard unpleasantness of the Giant Eagle experience, this location is also consistently dirty as well but at least I don't need to dance around beggars guarding the front door like I do at the Squirrel Hill location.", "Hash House A No Go!!!\\n\\nGiving this restaurant anything more than a two is insane!\\n\\nHad the fried chicken waffle thing.

So everything looks nice and new.\\n\\nOur hotel room was not good.  The tub was dirty.  There were lots of hairs in it.  We had to call housekeeping to clean it.  YUCK!  One of the lamps were broken and because the furniture in the room was black we could see all the dust.  It was like they didn't dust in weeks.  The tub though, is HUGE.  The biggest tub I've seen in a hotel room so far.  CRAZY HUGE!  There was a picture frame of an ugly looking vampire thing hanging on the wall.  That was pretty disturbing.  Most of the lights had this switch attached to it that was on the ground so that you could press it with your foot and the lamp would go on.  That was pretty different.

Our dog Charlie has had to go in every couple of months to have her thyroid levels checked as it runs low and is on medication. We have been working with Dr. Foster in keeping in at the level it should. So far frequent blood draws and changes in medication dosages. 2 weeks ago was her last blood draw and results and treatment have been withheld from us. Apparently the presiding vet is the only vet allowed to interpret the results regardless that their are other vets that are on staff that could interpret the results. Vets went on vacation, vets had days off and as yet we still have no results. we have had to schedule another meeting with our vet in order to hear the results.\\nThe earliest they seem to be able to do this is 3 weeks from the date the blood was drawn.

There specialty seems to be tamales but they have a pretty wide range of seafood offerings as well. I thought it was a little over priced, two chicken tacos with rice and beans were like $13. My  smothered carne asada burritto was ok, it looked like a giant enchiliada but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. The carne asada was very dry and the fillings could have used a bit more spice. The re-fried beans were mediocre but the Spanish style rice was pretty good.

Our waitress noted that they had mixed up several plates btu instead of offering to fic it assumed that we would just all trade portions of our plates to make a correct plate. UH NO! All of our baked potatoes were hard and cold. It was a mess. Then when the bill came the waitress didn't even acknowledge the poor service with an adjustment on the bill or even an i'm sorry.

The room smelled very horrible, it was like I stepped into a smoke oven. We could not breathe. They could not change rooms for us but for some odd reason they were able to check people in. The bathroom was extremely ridiculous; it was something I have never seen before. Since it was a handicap room there was no separation between the showers and the rest of the bathroom. So if someone took a shower the dirt and nasty stuff can spread all over the entire restroom, it was very visible. The dirt and grime were all over the floor, we were all scared to take off our shoes. It was really disgusting. We were promised another room but not until the next day. So we did what we did best, stayed up all night and avoid sleeping in that nasty room. However that lasted only so long, we were tired. Went back to the room around 6:30 in the morning and slept. Of course the air conditioning broke during the first hour of our nap. Great! We were sleeping in cigarette smell, we have a restroom you can walk into, it was about 90 degrees out and now our air conditioning broke. What's next? Our friend woke up around 8am and we had him go straight to the front desk so we can move to a new room. Luckily we received a new one, but the place looks shabby. Well at least the air conditioning worked. This was actually my first time I have ever stayed at Harrahs. Paris and all the other related hotels was booked.

The custards were good.  The yogurts were ok.  I don't get the hype over the twangy tart, it tasted like plain yogurt to me, which in and of itself tastes like spoiled milk.  No thanks.

There were two beds in the room and the air could only be felt on the bed CLOSEST to the fan. Walking in the room, we were greeted with a stuffy, hot atmosphere. Also, the bathroom got overwhelmingly hot, so that we had to keep the door open while taking a shower so we wouldn't have a heat stroke. The bathtub/shower was so high from the floor that I almost fell getting out of it at least twice, and NO I was not drunk.

The bruise's size and placement were exactly where they would be if you were to pinch the skin of her belly and squeeze with significant pressure. When I confronted the shop with my discovery, they swore they had no idea what happened and denied any involvement. No one attempted to apologize or accept responsibility. The fact remains that she had no such injuries when I brought her in.   I am shocked and appalled at what happened to my dog and how the situation was handled.

So he ask me all my info and he printed out some well he called it a receipt. Ok at this point I'm very ANGRY because 15 mins to 20 mins later i'm given a receipt with no address no phone number but what it does have is a misspelled name so (This still makes me mad as heck) Being that I was not getting any service I asked for the manager and what do you know the young lady standing next to George is a manager hear me when I say she was just standing their looking stupid. Just seeing me get angry and doing nothing but pecking on a laptop like she cant type. (See I didnt need help from Ana Bermudez) That's her name by the way. I called from my cell phone 611 and the sprint rep on my phone was very understanding as to why I was ANGRY and wanted to help me out ASAP so he called  the store where I was. (Keep in mind I'm only feet away from these people.) George answers the phone and says that the manager Ana Bermudez is with a client and hangs up on my sprint rep. I let the sprint rep know that Ana Bermudez is standing on about a foot away from me and is most def NOT with a client. He made notes in my account and said it was safe for me to go ahead and exit the store. I said NO way. I'm sorry NO can do. I requested my 164 back but was told they cant give a refund. I recalled my BFF use to contact the CEO of Sprint if she herself had any issues with Sprint. So I called her and got the CEO of Sprints email all a sudden when I said his email address aloud Sam Alias the general manager comes out the back and helps me and gives me a receipt and it only took about 3 mins. Its sad that I had to  jump thru hoops to get something that is due to me for being a Loyal customer. I have no idea what kind of trick o ree these people are up to but I will NEVER go back here Ever.

The gravy was a little too salty for my taste - and I add salt to nearly everything. Anita couldn't eat it. \\nPositive note: the pastry crust was perfect. \\n\\nIt took a while before they cleaned the table - and they did not ask if the main was to our satisfaction. \\nThe cranachan was good - well better than the main, nice & sweet and we finished that. \\nAfter that we went to pay and even though the bar staff didn't ask if we liked it, Anita A. mentioned our dissatisfaction, they were not too apologetic, but waved the supplement from our bill. \\n\\nMy experience here for a meal was an uncomfortable one and not to be repeated.

Wednesday was 50% off their salads and meatloaf. I decided to go with the Bruce Lee asian chicken salad and coupled it with a nice Pear Cider. I loved looking at all the memorabilia and the bartender was super nice. My salad was disgusting, to be frank. Limp lettuce with some canned mandarin oranges thrown on top and chicken that was cooked in the worst sauce, also strewn about and finally topped with way too much sesame dressing.

The french toast was not very good but what really annoyed me was how tiny the portion was for a 10 dollar dish. You can seriously give me more than TWO PIECES OF FREAKING BREAD for TEN DOLLARS. I was still hungry after but its okay I slurped down some of the bad (expensive too) coffee and decided I would wait until the airport for lunch (airport food was better by the way).

WHERE, oh where, sweet little unborn baby Jesus, should I start? I could start with the evident lack of oversight of this once pristine mall in North Phoenix. I could discuss how the consistent miscalculations of management derailed my favorite mall in my neighborhood. I could discuss how the last true department stores, Macy's and Sears, are clearly not hitting their numbers each month...its obvious. The food court is just sad, and I am not a food court guru. They have a sushi place, that is awesome....but holy hell, not one big-time chain that makes me remotely interested in eating. There are nicer movie theaters on other parts of town, and I choose to go there since the entertainment is better there as well. Of the tenants that are here, a couple are hawking cheap merchandise, one sports store is selling off old Glass Cage Sports merchandise (just look at the tags).. Its the epitome of a (insert expletive)-mess. It's actually embarrassing to say this was MY mall. I took pride in this place. Store after store after store have left, and I see none of them coming back. Its just as bad across the street, where Best Buy left many moons ago, and within the past few years Sports authority followed suit. Sports Chalet just left too. It makes me depressed, actually.....a mall, makes me depressed. It's sad, guys. Metro is shell of itself.\\n\\n~The Downlow~\\nYou know what this mall reminds me of? It reminds of the 9-digit disaster called the \\\"\"Scottsdale Galleria\\\"\". Remember it?!?! With the state of the art IMAX!?! Albeit, the Galleria lasted nowhere near as long as here, but its the premise of being an unused hulk. Metro in a sense is now the primary \\\"\"White Elephant\\\"\" in Phoenix. It just stands there, a shell of itself. I suggest coming here explicitly for Dillard's shopping center, they get one lone star for the Dillard's Center, it is outstanding! Maybe catch a movie too, the Harkins isn't the worst in the valley, its just in a wretched spot. Besides that, I am at a loss for words. Its just sad. So yea, come for those two things, enjoy the day hunting for bargains. Other than that, just pray someone has a chance to figure out a way to get this monolith bustling again...if that's even possible.", "Their 50% off for locals is a big rip off. They add on 18% gratuity on the full price of the meal and to top it off their food is not very good, it's mediocre Italian at best for their prices.", "With a name like C R Buns, the very least you would expect from them is that they make their our buns. But after ordering a burger and looking at the bun it was obviously NOT made there. I even asked about it and sure enough they get them from a local baker. So lets talk about that burger...\\n\\nThey use 1/4 pound patties (I am betting S&F) and opening prices of about $5.00 which I expect will go up if they have some success. The thing is everyone around other than Jack in the Box are using 1/3 to 1/2 pound patties and cooking them better. The fixings were fresh so that's a plus, but back to the bun again; while they do toast the buns they do not grill them with say a butter coating, hence the heel gets soggy and falls apart. By half way through the sandwich (my wife ordered a chicken sandwich) we were both eating the sandwich upside down. It is obvious that they do not understand how to make a simple burger.\\n\\nSimilar observations can be made about the chicken grilled sandwich and the sides. C R Buns like so many others probably gets almost all their food from US Foods or SYSCO or Rykoff(H&O) or some such making their food just like everyone else.\\n\\nSuggestions: Ice Tea drinker drink a lot of Iced Tea... get bigger cups for the Iced Tea and servers will have to tend to them less often improving service.\\n\\nMy wife ordered a Newcastle (I don't drink) and the beer was cool, but not cold. Beer should be served at 38 degrees and this was not close. Also, my wife was not even offered a glass for the beer, just the bottle. WHILE SOME PEOPLE DRINK STRAIGHT FROM THE BOTTLE OTHERS THINK IT IS MORE SANITARY TO OFFER A GLASS. THINK ABOUT IT.\\n\\nYou need to cook your pizzas longer, they looked under cooked and two tables left half their pizzas in the plate. BTW, if you have pizza ovens, why couldn't you make your own buns in the morning and then turn them up to 700 after for the pizzas? That would help meet expectations and give a better product.\\n\\nYou do not have a walk up register for people to pay at and your servers are slow in servicing the checks. Along that idea, are you getting check skippers? You have two exits and that is usually a no no for most dining establishments. Also, in case you do get robbed, if the register is near the exit it keeps the robber away from customers whose safety is then your biggest concern.\\n\\nAmbiance and Decor; what decor? A few surf boards hanging around do not make decor. Exposed electrical conduit look awful and the standard beer company neon's are kitsch to say the least.\\n\\nThere are no beer taps and unless the place really picks up in business I would not expect taps. For one think they would have to devote space in a walk-in refrigerator for kegs and I do not think they have the space. Also, to run refrigerated lines for the beer is expensive and would require more construction costs. If you went light on the decor I do not see them spending more for taps.\\n\\nThere is definitely a lack of concept here, they are trying to be all things to all people and have lost the \\\"\"idea of one\\\"\". Pick one thing or idea and do it better than anyone else and you will be ahead of the game. The rule of one meets expectations and allows for growth.\\n\\nBut then again what do I know.", "the casino is lovely.  cashiers at the buffet need a lesson in manners!    we stood in the handicap line for 20 minutes when we arrived at the cashier she wanted proof of my disability.  i explained that i was from out of town and the only 'proof' was the tag on the car.  she said 'well that's your problem' and moved on to the next person.   i asked why she couldn't just take our money and her response was i was in the wrong line, if i didn't like it i could call a manager.  there is no mention on the sign for the handicap line that you need proof.\\n\\ni was tempted to leave but decided to speak with a manager.   he stuck a thumb size blue sticker on my players card and told me to go through the vip line so we didn't have to wait again.   same cashier, she couldn't get rid of us fast enough.  my husband said he nearly got a paper cut from her tearing the money out of his hand.    \\n\\ni wasn't asking for a discount or a free meal just what the sign said,  the right to stand in line for handicapped people.  we won't be back and will tell all our friend to stay away!", "What What?.?.?....

This time, the bartender didn't like the tip my friend left (which was the standard of a couple bucks per drink) and blew her whistle and continued to call my friend out on it in front of the whole bar!! She's lucky she even got a tip after making us wait for half an hour while serving people who just walked up to the bar after me when i was obviously there before them. The bartenders here act like total mean girls and its a very unpleasant experience. They bully customers and act so unprofessionally. No wonder nobody tips them. They're all a bunch of nasty mean girls. I'd give negative stars if I could.", "Other than the delicious cheddar biscuits, I find the service horrible and the food way over-priced. I ordered the 4-course meal. Soup & salad came out pretty quickly. They were OK. Not great/not awful. I wasn't even 1//4 of the way through either when the main course showed up. As a former server, there's no excuse for that. You watch the table and drop the order for the rest of the meal to approximately coincide with the customer finishing soup &/or salad. (And they weren't busy.) The waitress brought the check before bringing the dessert that is included in the 4-course meal. I had to ask for a refill of tea. The scallops in the linguine were the size of mini-marshmallows and poor quality. Sorry, but the cheddar biscuits aren't enough to bring me back. Las Vegas has many excellent choices for seafood and Red Lobster is not one of them.", "You get what you pay for.  I wish I had realized this before booking a room there through Orbitz.  We stayed in the most elegant section of the hotel called \\\"\"The Manor\\\"\", which was truly awful.  You exit the main building, walking across a street of traffic, through an unrestricted parking lot where anyone can access, to one of five standalone buildings where you have no access to any amenities (unless, of course, you trek back into the main building).     Our room smelled, and our curtains (being on the ground floor) didn't close all the way and left a crack through which someone could peek through walking by.   Needless to say we didn't stay there that night, and we high-tailed it out of there and booked elsewhere.   While trying to save money by being really cheap through Orbitz and staying at Circus Circus, I ended up spending double what I wanted to spend.   You get what you pay for.   It's my own fault for not understanding the room situation before I booked.  blech!", "A little more pretentious than I expected from reading other reviews.  Good luck finding parking.

I ordered the carnitas(fried porks pieces) and what I got was like five chunks of dry flavorless pork. Not good kinda left feeling sick. The rest of the food ordered by the rest of my party was none to appetizing either.

It had a big \\\"\"Come In\\\"\" sign. When you open the door you walk through the kitchen, kinda awkward, but whatevs. We look at the menu.. I decide to order a salad and my husband picks a sandwich, Great! Go to order and find out that sandwiches are only served untill 5. Ok, no big deal, but why doesn't the menu say that? OK, he will have a salad too , except he wants to modify it a bit. Hmm the salads are pre-made so that's not happening. I order my salad and he will look over the menu while we sit down. We head over the the main seating area, only to be told we can not sit there because we ordered our food on the grocery side. It would have been great for somebody to tell us that! So we head to the grocery side to find seating. Well, the seating on the grocery side is minimal and it was not kid friendly. We decided to go ask for a refund for my untouched salad so that we could have dinner where we could sit comfortably. They redeemed themselves when we were told of picnic benches available to sit and offered to bring us a high chair. It kinda of bothered me that we were only offered a highchair AFTER asking for a refund. It's standard practice to offer a high chair for people with children. I orderd the Sanoma Garden Salad. It was ok, but nothing amazing and the portion was rather small.  My husband decided to get food elsewhere", "Avoid this place like the plague.  Jack isn't a nice guy, he isn't dependable and he will lie straight to your face.\\n\\nBrought my car in because the check engine light was on and we had been told we needed to replace the timing belt.

And where did we go the next morning?  Back to the shop - but this time Jack, the owner, was there.  And what an unplesant, rude, disrespectful man he is.  I cannot believe he owns a business.  He flat out lied to my face when he told me that \\\"\"Chuck\\\"\" had drained my gas tank and found it full of gunk.  Funny, I had the same amount of gas when I dropped it off and no one had mentioned that had been done.\\n\\n2 days later, now we are being told the computer is fried - another $2k worth of work.

We've eaten at this Chompie's three times and we're always disappointed. However we've eaten at other Chompie's, most often the one in Chandler, and we're stuffed and happy. I don't get it.\\n\\nWe went with a group of Yelpers to this Chompie's because it's close to Gammage and we were all attending the opening night production of Fiddler on the Roof. So I suggested JewFood. Now, being an east coast Jew, I have certain standards which, frankly, aren't easily met in the desert. But they're not met at this Chompie's at all.\\n\\nI phoned at 3:00 that afternoon to give them a heads up since we were expecting twelve people (we wound up with eight - you know how Yelpers are). I gave them the count, the time and made clear that we had a time crunch, needing to be out of there by 6:00 - 6:15 at the latest. When we got there the table wasn't ready.\\n\\nWe were seated fitteen minutes later and I told both the host and the server that we were attending the theatre and needed to eat and get going. Our food arrived at 5:45 or 5:50. I can't say for sure which it was. Had a hard time getting more pickles, I never got the lemons I asked for, sauces had to be requested repeatedly. And the food was nothing to write home to Bubbeh about. My extra lean corned beef was fatty and chewy and my daughter's patty melt, requested with extra onions came with a mere four pieces of onion. She asked for more but they didn't arrive until she was nearly done eating. I would have contested the extra charge for those onions but I had to get going or risk losing the opportunity to park in the Gammage lot. From the rumblings I heard around the table, we weren't the only disappointed diners in our party.\\n\\nNow I've reviewed the Chompie's in Chandler https://www.yelp.com/biz/chompies-restaurant-and-bakery-chandler and gave it five stars. So the problems clearly aren't pervasive, in my opinion. If we'd had time we would have gone to the Chompie's in Chandler or the one in Scottsdale but the Tempe location was five minutes from Gammage. Oh, well. I'll consider this my farewell address. I won't be back to the Tempe Chompie's again.", "I chose this place for somewhere different and the reviews were mixed.\\n \\nThe website's view of the inside of the bar is taken from a wide angle lens and it was smaller than I expected but I liked the eclectic feel. \\nThe music was good but the drinks were horrible (watered down and tasteless) the saki was watered down too. \\nWe just went there for appetizers and drinks and the food was less than average, like supermarket sushi at Trader Joes, bland. \\n\\nQuite a few guys with guys, so if you are a single lady or a married one who's husband got hit on like me, then pass this place up. \\n\\nThe toilet was the only nice thing about this place.", "I would give this a zero if it was possible.

The waitress' attempt to apologize was really a bunch of excuses.", "I just ordered this, and when I got it.. I opened it and was so grossed out! The pot stickers looked so slimy like giant boogers in a styrofoam box! The beef with broccoli was no better.. It did NOT taste like beef.. Which makes me wonder what animal is this! It was mooshy and slimy! The fried rice was dry and flavorless... I will NOT be eating here again!", "My son and I went to Charleston's for the first time last week.  It was a little after 8 pm and there were two other tables occupied. First of all, although the waitress was very nice, she had no idea about their menu...she did not know whether their filet was filet mignon or not. \\n\\n We asked for bread (which they do not give to you unless you ask...tacky) and sat there for ten minutes waiting for it....finally flagged down another server and then our waitress brought it over.\\n\\n I ordered a prime rib end cut and my son got the filet.  His filet was fine-not great, but okay. For the VERY first time in my life, I had to send back a meal- I just do not send things back... I make do, make mental notes and move on. The end cut was the worst thing I have ever seen! I have NEVER been served something like this in my life! It was like an end cut of a slab of stew meat. It was very thick, no fat or marbling (which is what makes the end cut so delicious and horrible for you) and it was so dry that I LITERALLY had trouble swallowing my first and only bite. Oh, and it was warm/cool, not hot (which really didnt matter, because it was not edible).  They brought me a steak instead and sadly, it was a thin sad looking steak that one might see at Dennys or some such establishment and it had some sort of gravy on it...didnt taste like the kind of steak one expects at a place that boasts about their steaks; I brought it home for my dogs.  Perhaps their burgers are better, but we will NEVER go back there. It was literally the worst dining I have had in over 10 years!!", "The fried chicken is nothing special.

After the oil change was complete,  I was told my oil change would be $74 dollars.  $74 dollars for a standard oil change?  really?  I spoke with the manger, i wanted them to put my old filter back in and put my old oil back in my car.  I wasn't going to pay for that.

I looked closer and the stations themselves were clean, but the supply carts, airbrush station, and areas behind the chairs were filthy.  The selection of polishes was slim and also needed some cleanup with lots of painted-on bottles (glad I brought my own!). People had test painted colors all over the rack of polishes.  It seems than one careless individual inspired everyone else to do the same (I had never seen this).  Even when visiting cheaper nail salons, I'd like them to have a clean and relaxing environment.  \\n\\nThe pedicure itself was pretty good when judging the quality of the nail job itself.  The technician was gentle and precise.

While there were many good craft beers to try, maneuvering the festival was down right miserable.  Festival management has room to improve for next year.\\n\\nParking was a total cluster.  Seemed as though they only made sure enough space existed for the expected participation level, but forgot to think about the efficiency of traffic flow.  The walk to the festival entrance from the parking was a road trip and a half without the use of your car.\\n\\nLine efficiency was non-existant.  Most breweries offered 2-4 options and were not efficient at delivering.  Often many beer servers/pourers had to toggle back and forth/change places in order to serve the requested brew.  Lines were on average 30-40 people long.  So, you grabbed a pour and went to stand in the next line of interest.  Not the relaxing and fun experience that I was looking forward to.  \\n\\nThey offer a single small plastic tasting cup.  In every other tasting event I've attended there were rinsing stations with water and/or napkins.  Without the ability to taste each beer without remnants of the previous, it becomes difficult to evaluate theeach unique flavor profile.\\n\\nIt was very hot and icky, and there was an extreme shortage of shade or shelter.

I stopped a gentleman with Grey hair in his mid forties who I think was possibly a manager. I asked him where I could find the rent-able carpet cleaners, He acted annoyed to have to help me and shuffled me over to the carpet rentals. I asked if he had used it before and he said yes briskly. He then yelled over to a girl at the register and told her to ring me up. He said when she was finished to come find him so he could tell her something seemed like helping me was preventing him and her from doing something that was more important than the sale. The girl was friendly but just told me to sign in the purple area and rang me up. She told me the cleaner was $29.00 but after I swiped my card and had to confirm the amount it said it was $42? I asked was it a mistake and she said there was a deposit which was never explained to me. I took the device home used it and it worked well. My boyfriend & I went to return it tonight and the experience got even better. We walk in and a friendly PetSmart employee asked how it was. As she was being friendly another employee who was on the phone came over and told her to check the bottom of the machine. She flipped the machine over and told me that it was dirty on the bottom and would keep my deposit because I failed to clean it. The tone that she said this in was where I had a problem. The other cashier suggested I go and \\\"\"hose it down\\\"\"....because a hose is just outside of Pet Smart...umm yea OK! Then  Lisa (a manager by the way)  took her finger and started saying how now she would have to call Bissell and have a tech come clean the machine and how it is un-rentable. She made me feel like I had brought this back filthy and almost like I was a bad human for having used it and it have some pet hair. She sent the other employee away and I told her how I did not appreciate her tone and that I did not receive an inspection of the machine when I rented it so how do I know that it was not already that way. She then tells me that there is no way she would send a machine like that into someones home and then she took the copy of the contract held it up and took her pin and in a stern annoyed voice read to me all the things I agreed to. She made sure to take the pen and point to the part where it says you will return it clean. She then set the paper down and went on to say how she doesn't know how to return the deposit to me and that she has to return it then recharge it and how she had never done a transaction with these machines before. I asked her what needed to be cleaned on the machine and if I could take a paper towel to it? She said \\\"\"maybe\\\"\" but that she still would probably need to charge me and how only the professional tech can clean it at this point. I told her as a business practice I feel they should explain to people renting the machines the expectations and do an inspection so that people are not paying deposits for something that they may not have done.  I work in customer service and would not have minded losing the deposit but the tone and attitude I received from Lisa was beyond rude.  I go to many Pet Smart locations but I must say this is the worst.  If I didn't receive such amazing service from the Dysart-Goodyear location I would never return to a PetSmart after my experience today.  If either employee I was forced to deal with today is a manager they should be ashamed.  I feel bad for both of the friendly employees I had to deal with as I would never want to work with people like that.  DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION unless you like horrible customer service, lack of supplies that all other stores are stocked with and want to pay deposits on machines you were not aware were dirty.

Don't eat their food or expect good customer service.", "Great Beer Selection, Great Wings, Mostly Bad Service, Horrible Management.\\n\\nLet me preface this by saying that I've been a regular of the Come Back In for more than a decade, the earlier years out of choice, more recently because ...  well, I think it's really just that my friends like the free peanuts and popcorn and I get outvoted if I suggest going elsewhere too often.\\n\\nPROS:\\n\\n- The afore-mentioned free popcorn (good and salty - serve yourself as you come in next to the bar) and free peanuts in the shell (ask for them at the bar).\\n\\n- They have an excellent beer selection, roughly two dozen tap beers split evenly between Wisconsin microbrews, other American microbrews, and imports, plus a big case filled with a good variety of imports and in-state and other American microbrews in the bottle.  Like something German next door at the Essen Haus?  Ask for it and they'll pop through the adjoining door and get you a mug of it (same ownership).\\n\\n- Their buffalo wings are very good, as good as any in town from BW3, Quaker Steak & Lube, or anywhere else, plus are bigger and meatier (I usually ask for them to cook them extra crispy to make sure they're fully done) and only cost 50 cents each.\\n\\n- They have a beer club.  Every sixth tap beer you order is free, fill out the card (around 40-50 beers) and get a free meal.\\n\\n- Some of their servers and a few of their bartenders are very pleasant and are really nice and give good service.  Don't expect to see them again next time you pop in a month later, though (see below)\\n\\n-They have some interesting stuff as decorations (huge Native American arrowhead collection, lots of vintage UW sports memorabilia, lots of vintage beer cans, signs, tap handles, etc..)\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\n- The regular weekday bartender, the bespeckled Jen, the only front-of-the-house employee to survive here long-term, is, to be blunt, mediocre-to-crappy in every way.  She might look like a kindly librarian, but she's stingy and gives the bare minimum of service.  She has poured hundreds of beers for me over the years, and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM has been a short pour.  Think that a bartender should offer something on-the-house to a regular customer (up until then a good tipper, too) on his birthday?  That's reasonable, isn't it?  Well, not to Jen.  Think a bartender should tell long-standing regulars about the bar's beer club so they can avail themselves of free beers?  Jen sure didn't - she kept mum about it for years and it was only when a short-lived new bartender who asked us for our beer club numbers and explained about the program that we learned of it.  Jen, if you read this review, it's time to learn that a gratuity-based service provider who doesn't provide good service doesn't deserve a good tip - that's why you're probably making less money now than you did 5 or 10 years ago.\\n\\n- The manager, a middle-aged guy with 1960's glasses and a mean stare is, to be blunt, one of the least friendly, most unpleasant, most overbearing, least-customer service-oriented,  etc... (I could go on with negatives to exhaust the review word count without coming close to finishing) .  When I discovered that the lovely Jen had failed to tell us about the beer club and refused to do something about it, I talked to the manager, explained that as I was sure he recognized, my friends and I were regulars for years, we had lost out on free beers for years.  He mumbled a curt \\\"\"Sorry\\\"\" and walked away.  I was astonished.  I had to chase him down and told him that we had essentially been cheated out of many free beers and that as regulars of his bar for a decade, he ought to do something about it for us.  He grumbled and bitterly said \\\"\"OK, I'll give you a free round.\\\"\"   That was it.  One free beer each.  Additionally, the manager hovers and over-supervises, making for a unpleasant atmosphere, plus he's a royal ass to his employees, which is why this bar has probably the highest turnover rate of any business in town.  Given that most bartenders, for the few weeks that they can stand working here, won't fill a beer mug all the way,  I suspect that the manager orders them to pour short.\\n\\n- The food, other than the wings, is so-so, very typical bar food, not as good as the late night menus from Chilis, Applebees, etc...  Breakfast is supposed to be good, but haven't had it.\\n\\nAs soon as the new Ale Asylum brewpub opens near the airport, I think I need to convince our gang to frequent there or else to the Malt House for beer or Alchemy for beer and food when service has been too bad at the Come Back In.  As I write this, I feel kind of dumb for having given this bar so much of my business over the years.  In summary, if you like good beer and good Buffalo wings,  plus can tolerate mediocre-at-best service, you might like this joint.

Our waiter was extremely attentive and humorous, which saved this from being a one-star review, as I left the restaurant in quite a good mood.\\n\\nHow could a restaurant known for superb service and delicious food (my trout with toasted almonds and green beans was flavorful and rich without being too heavy) even warrant the consideration of a one-star rating after it already received a four-star rating?\\n\\nThe snooty (or maybe she was just slow) hostess is the reason behind this.  My sister and I showed up for a late dinner last night at a time when there were plenty of empty tables.  After approaching one of the hostesses (the blonde one in her mid-to-late forties), she hesitated as she gave us the once-over and said our table would be ready in a few minutes.  Close to half an hour later, it was not.  She had just simply decided that we weren't good enough to be served based on either age, dress, or race.  Or maybe all that cheap hair dye eroded at her brain and she wasn't capable of remembering to seat patrons.  Whatever it was, management at Bouchon might want to retrain their staff and remind them that the restaurant business is not just about food, it's about service and the overall .  And service doesn't only start when patrons are seated.  It starts the moment customers walk through the door and lasts until they leave.  \\n\\nThe way to circumvent a situation like this is to just make an OpenTable reservation on the spot.  Works a lot better than relying on a hostess to do her job properly.  Remembering to seat people can be way too taxing of a task for some.", "The majority of the one star rating is due to the club blocking a picture of my best friend and his boyfriend kissing on the outside photo stand. My other friends took pictures kissing and were just fine. When viewing the photos there was my best friend and his man smiling, two \\\"\"hetero\\\"\" friends kissing, the blocked picture, and then a couple kissing who were also \\\"\"hetero.\\\"\" After the picture of the two boys kissing I did notice a bouncer giving them a dirty look but thought he was just a pathetic hater and dismissed it. That is such a huge disappointment to know that this club could be so narrow minded and discriminatory. This just adds to the appallingly rude employees we encountered on our journey to get into the club. All in all I will definitely not be returning to a club who is not LGBTQ friendly and I will be telling others to save themselves the money and time they'll waste at this club.", "We sat in the tavern to check out the place. We ordered the small fish and chips. Small is a understatement. The fish, the size of 3 small fish sticks on a bed of what tasted like the inside of a dirty fish tank. It was greasy and horribly fishy tasting. It came with a shot glass of French fries. Yes about 6 French fries total. I should have sent back the way over priced dish, but it was just a taste of food, what would I have sent back? 3 fries and 1 fish stick?\\nI did notice that there are over 300 great reviews, I hope the rest of the food is far better. So my advice is don't have the fish and chips or the less expensive ($12) glasses of wine.", "We went to this buffet as part of the \\\"\"Buffet of Buffets\\\"\" pass purchased at one of the other casinos.

I began scanning the flavors to see which I would like to try and was approached by the employee. I asked if she would wash her hands before serving me my samples and with a stank face she said she would. After trying two samples, I was already disturbed by the unfriendly attitude I was receiving. My friend had already decided on getting a medium , so I decided to get a small of the flavor that I did enjoy. Since we had just eaten dinner, we got the ice cream to go and  asked the employer if she had ice to package with our gelato. She crammed lids onto the top of the cups which oozed gelato all over the side. I had a bad feeling about the outcome of this packaging, but was ready to get my gelato and go. She filled a bag with ice and put the two gelatos in the bag. My friend and I got home and were livid to find that the lids had fallen off and the gelato had melted all over the ice-filled bag. We called to complain and the owner told us the only way we could get a refund was if we came back to the store. With melted gelato in hand, we headed twenty minutes back to the shop, showed the owner the bag, and got a cash refund.

I was starving too.  I was born in Beijing, and coming from San Francisco which is dominated by sichuan and cantonese style Chinese food, I was really excited to eat northern chinese food again(yes, I know dao xiao mian is not only served in Northern China but that's where I've had the best mian.)\\n\\nThe mian was alright, it wasn't great, but the large price tag(only tomatoes and eggs!), and the knowledge of how much it costs in China, just didn't sit well with me.  The dumplings are just average, and they had the premade frozen taste to them.  They taste like what I make and really, that's not good for a restaurant with real chefs.  The Xiao long bao was just average, again though, I'm probably spoiled as I'm used to the crab meat and roe ones from Shanghai's Cheng Huang Miao.\\n\\nTo be completely fair though, I was comparing the prices to what I'd get in Beijing, for a little bit of homesickness, it was disappointing nonetheless.\\n\\nAlso, fish tanks were kinda weird for me.

Our morning started out ok, we were picked up at 7 from our hotel on a small shuttle that drove us to a parking lot where the big \\\"\"luxury\\\"\" bus picked us up. An African American male that checked us in the big bus was very rude to me, he asked me rudely to get off the bus and let the rest of the group of the person in front of me to come first. He touched my arm and pushed me to turn around. After the other driver (Caucasian male) who constantly said he has been doing this for over 20 years started out nicely as well then his patience started going downhill. He reminded us about 20 times to make sure we are at a Bright Angel lodge at 3:15 or else he would leave us. He made fun of a group of Asian tourists that were part of our bus that appeared lost once we arrived at the Bright Angel lodge. He was making negative remarks about their behavior, making them look dumb and letting he whole bus now about this. I felt like an elementary school student the whole time as he appeared to treat us like such. On the way back we make many, many different spots to the hotel of each of the passengers! It is super boring the way back. We stopped at this stinky dirty gas station to use the restrooms. The food provided was ok, just enough to hold me from starving all day. The only positive is that the movies provided were entertaining and that the bus was not crowded. Next time, we are driving and not taking any tours!!", "I would rather eat Ramen noodles.

My mother and I's room was sweltering hot because the air conditioners had been turned off. In my father's room they did not bother to even make the bed or put any blankets on it. My bed when you sat on it both corners folded up to you and you bounced any time you moved at all. I went down later that morning and I talked to a very nice young lady who said she would move all three rooms and for the inconvenience give us a credit on the rooms. My room and my mother's room was moved my Father WAS NEVER MOVED AS PROMISED. The new rooms were passable but barely. I went down Monday morning to make sure everything was ok with billing and to get my boarding pass printed out.

I don't know if they usually don't ask, but I do sort of expect that when I order a burger. My thinking is if they don't ask, they only serve it one way, and if that is the way I received mine then I don't know how this place gets raves for their burgers. It was well done, completely overcooked, charred on the outside and not juicy at all. In my book, juicy is they key component of a great burger. The patty itself was fairly small and dwarfed by the bun. As my wife said, charge a buck more and add some ground beef. My wife's basic hamburger was the same way - charred, overcooked and dry. The bun was good, though. The fries were also very good but not good enough to make me go back just for the fries. The fries are a side show to the main event of the burger.\\n\\nAs for the service, it started out OK and stayed there. I ordered a Blue Paddle beer. When the server delivered it she asked if I would like an orange to go with it. I said yes but it never showed up. Our water was refilled as needed, which was nice although expected.

Enjoyed eating there before.", "Food was fine.  Service was abysmal.  I thought we were on a hidden camera show it was so bad.  Aloof chick server who couldn't remember my order no matter how manny times I repeated.  Awful.", "The pizza was excellent...not the best in the country, however. That honor should go to Via Tribunali in Seattle. The crust was perfect, the biancoverde pizza our favorite. Why 2 stars? We arrived at 5:45 p.m. on a blistering 113 degree Saturday night and were told we would be seated in 2-3 hours. Ok. Not great, but ok. The scam is that you have to wait at their bar next door or be forced to check in every hour. By their time calculations we should have been seated around 8:15 p.m. Guess when we sat down to dinner, folks? 9:30 p.m. We spent that time spending $$ in their not-so-well-cooled bar with not very many seats. Nice way to get 2 tabs out of one evening, restaurant owners! Once we were seated in the actual restaurant, we also sat at a bar. We love bar seating--however, this bar has one side with leg room, the other side has no leg room. Our awesome luck continuing, I was wearing a skirt, and guess which side we were seated at? It was not a good arrangement. Their waiters didn't feel like waiters, more like expediters working the floor. After suffering through the indignity of an outrageously long wait, one of these expediters didn't approach us for another 10 minutes. Now it's 9:40-ish. Finally we get service, which was on the gruff side. I still can't sit at the bar quite right, so when a couple leaves the other side of the bar (the side that has leg room), I approach the manger to see if we can move. Perhaps a tiny victory, but a victory nonetheless. We spend the next 20 minutes talking about the very good pizza in an set up that hucks the bucks from those who wait...and everyone does. Even though we enjoyed the pizza, we won't be going back. Tip: the bald bartender said their slowest season/slowest nights were May-September, Wednesdays and Thursdays. If you must, go once to get it out of your system. If you're a glutton for punishment, then you have found your favorite new restaurant.", "We were very disappointed with Japonais.  The sushi's quality is just ok and way over priced ($8-$16 for each piece, not an order of at least 2 pieces).  The Robata was worse- unimaginative and again over priced (an order of shishito peppers consisted of 4 small peppers on a skewer with no sauce or bonito flakes).  Go to Nobu instead.", "Must be the A-Team works after 10pm because this place was horrible.  I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches, and cheeseburger with fries at the drive-through and was immediately put off by this place.  I asked the guy if I could have a second to think about my order and he seemed to think that this was a major inconvenience to him when he stated \\\"\"whatever\\\"\" after I asked. Once I got home I opened the bag to eat my food.  I found that they had only given me one chicken sandwich(I realize I should've checked before I drove off, but I assumed they knew how to count).  Then I took out my cheeseburger and fries only to find out that they were pretty much frozen, awesome.  So, I will definitely not be coming here again.", "Never again.\\n\\nMy room was not clean, no wifi, the lamps are screwed down to the table and they surprise you with a $20 resort fee.

One thing that this place is great for is getting you out of there quickly! I know between 8-8:30am there's a line out the door and that can be discouraging but don't let that hinder you. The staff there are lightning quick with your orders. I don't give them any more stars because I got the same coffee I order anywhere I got (Crazy Mocha, Starbucks) and this is by far the most disgusting one I've had. I know their coffee isn't great but this batch this morning was just awful. The cinnamon and cream cheese bagel that I had a coupon for was pretty legit though.

Only 3 of us. 2 adults 1 preteen and he's very hungry boy who loves Chili's and knows exactly what he wants. The waiter was thought he know better what we should have and not in a helpful way. Our boy ordered his usual hot wings and when we asked if he wanted anything else the waiter butted in and said \\\"\"Oh, you'll have plenty to eat\\\"\" Well, he's old enough to know how much he can eat with no help from the staff. Then he told us we needed cocktails. Uh, no we wanted sodas/tea. He never noticed we only had 2 place settings even when we finally got our appetizer (messy) so we shared forks and napkins. I walked around trying to find some sugar for my iced tea and after I asked for some it was awhile until I got it. We then sat and watched 3 new tables order and get their meal while we waited. It seriously wasn't anymore busy for our waiter then the others. We finally received our meal and the waiter was surprised we asked if our son could have some silverware/napkins with his meal. it barely made it on our table as he flew past with it. Our drinks were empty before we got our meal (HUGE deal for me) but we eventually got refills. When done our son wanted his usual cheesecake. We had to nearly beg the waiter to let us order him dessert (he's 12) and then he was made to feel bad when the waiter just couldn't believe he didn't want the hot pan cookie/icream thing. He's had the darn thing before!  Then as we watched more tables come and go we finally got our check THEN waited for the guy to take the money. I had to actually make it super visible since he didn't get the hint when the tray sat at the edge of the table forever. Then he came over complaining about \\\"\"Women\\\"\"! and something about seeing the movie \\\"\"The Hobbit\\\"\" as he then went on to tell us he owed us $.70  Hello, I'm a woman and I want to see the movie!  I would have paid $7.70 to get the heck out of there.  Went in the bathroom and toilets were unflushed and the silk flowers had long term dust on them. ICK!

I thought the extra lean brisket there was decent, but not as good as Rudy's, which I recommend as an alternative. One thing that rankled me about Texas BBQ House was the high price on the stuffed baked potato. Another issue was the parking. Finally, the dining area was very cramped.

Upon noticing the ad, I drove to the facility itself to check it out (I live less than a mile away).  The golf course, while on the smaller side, appeared to be decently maintained and located conveniently to the Henderson community.  I am not a golfer, and I don't know many people who are, but I would assume when one is looking for a golf course or country club, they look for key features such as a nicely maintained landscape, decently sized clubhouse, and friendly staff.  One out of three, ain't bad, 'eh?\\n\\nThe clubhouse for this facility was nothing terribly impressive.  The course itself seemed a tad on the \\\"\"hard\\\"\" side- meaning, for a golf course, I would imagine a softer green would be preferred.  However, the prices were reasonable for golf, particularly in Las Vegas, so that could be a bonus.  \\n\\nAfter my investigation, I called to speak to the director of Food and Beverage, and was directed to her extension by a young man who answered the phone, and referred to this director by the wrong first name.  Curious.  As a potential job candidate, one doesn't want to make a bad first impression by referring to the Manager by the wrong name!  Once I got in touch with the director/Manager, she was extremely rude.  I mean we're taking, beyond rude!  She claimed that they hadn't placed an ad online (which they had), and that they've had the same staff \\\"\"for years\\\"\", and no one is hiring anybody.  She kept telling me \\\"\"I don't know where you got this information from...I don't do Craigslist\\\"\" as if looking for a bartending job in the classified posts online was like the worst, most horrific thing that one could do!  Her tone and demeanor were rude, judgmental, and extremely off-putting.  I have to say, that for a golf course whose main positive feature is that they are \\\"\"cheap\\\"\", she had the attitude of a 5-star resort CEO, and the communication skills of a high school drop-out.  Based on terrible customer service alone, I would not recommend golfing at this facility.  There are a few other very nicely maintained courses in the Las Vegas area, with much friendlier staff, and affordable prices.", "Ok, I hate this place.  I am only giving it the extra 2nd star because I was able to get in VIP...and the bouncers are actually very nice there.\\nWhy do I hate this place?  First of all, the go-go dancers there are a joke.  The people that were there were just plain nasty wanna-be somethings...I don't even think there is a name for it.

After a debate they fixed the boning that was literally cutting threw dress and stabbing me, and the sash that was sewn on wrong. When I got the dress back there was a Shoe print on the CREAM colored Sash! So when I said I would be taking the dress to a more reputable place for the alterations they were actually surprised. It gets worse. The other bridesmaid in the wedding got her alterations done on site. Her dress came back BURNT. A dark stain from the steamer THEY used! Also on the cream colored sash.  That same Bridesmaid paid for a rush on her dress, which then was, surprise, surprise NOT rushed. Then it was ridiculous trying to get the $ back.  Okay ready for the icing on the cake? My best friend the BRIDE had her dress altered. She went in for the final fitting to find out they had brought it in so much it was hard to zip and the sweetheart neckline was still too gapping, the only thing she needed fixed! They also added VISIBLE tacks to the train where it did NOT need them and it made the train twist up. The hem was too short. The side seams were the ruching should have met up was lumpy unaligned and unflattering. The back of the dress was also bulging were it never had before.  This was 15 days till the wedding. And how much did they charge for their shoddy work you may wonder? $400 after quoting and guaranteeing it would only be $200. They can't sew their way threw a sock puppet! We proceeded to take the dress to 2 other seamstresses who couldn't believe how butchered it was. Neither of those ladies could fix it either since it was purchased elsewhere.

Still seems weird to me, couples where female looks like a runway model, guy-with looks like he just got out of work at Home Depot. I guess I spent too much of the time thinking about this and conducting a scientific study. Anyhow, loud music, lots of glitz and glam, a necessary part of every young person's life. Lots of people looked way too young to be here. Some people looked way too old to be here. I think the thrill of standing behind the velvet ropes and waiting to be let in adds to the allure.

A while ago, I came to this branch just to deposit a check. I don't know what it is with the Wells Fargo branches in Las Vegas, but there seems to be a serious lack of envelope-free ATMs here. I guess I was spoiled when living in Southern California. I rarely had to step into the bank because any check deposited through those envelope-free ATMs would post to your account the same day and the funds would be available immediately.\\n\\nAnyway, I'll be nice and not name the teller and personal banker that helped me that day. They were trying to get me to open another account with them. I had to stand there and listen to them explain how every customer should have 5-6 different accounts under their name because of security reasons, all those scams going on, etc., etc. Don't get me wrong, I understand what they were trying to say and believe me, if I was a millionaire and had nothing better to do, I would love to put all that money in 10 different accounts. But it was a busy day for me, I had tons of stuff to do, and I really didn't have time to hang out at the bank. So I politely declined, thanked them for the information and told them that I would definitely keep that in mind. A few days later I noticed that they opened 2 new accounts under my name without my permission! WTF?! I called the branch and talked to the manager.

There are some really nice places in Montreal for excellent coffee, and this simply doesn't compare.  It's little more than a sports bar with an incredibly effective word of mouth campaign.\\n\\nThe espresso itself violates all laws of good preparation.  It isn't ground fresh for each shot, which is an instant red flag.  The baristas use not only grounds that have been sitting in the doser for several minutes, but even those that have fallen into the mountain of grounds sitting beneath the grinder.  The espresso sits alone in the glass for quite a while before the steamed milk is added, which degrades the aromatics and allows the crema to dissipate.  The milk itself is 'resteamed', which means new milk is poured into batches of already steamed milk and steamed again, which adds off-flavors and denatures proteins, preventing the development of quality microfoam, and it is a technique commonly associated with places like Starbucks that focus more on pushing customers through the door than on quality.  More than that, it isn't steamed in traditional latte or cappuccino pitchers, but in containers that could not possibly produce the vortex necessary to properly incorporate air into the steamed milk, and it shows in the product, a completely separated pitcher of hot milk topped with a poor macrofoam that shouldn't even be used for cappuccinos.  The espresso I received there had a thin film of crema that rapidly disappeared. I was nearly incapable of finishing it, let alone enjoying it.  It was a shot that any self-respecting third wave coffee shop would immediately pour down the drain and prepare again.\\n\\nI can't stress enough that this place, far from being 'one of the best coffee shops in North America', can't even compete with many chain establishments in Montreal in terms of coffee quality.  If you want to go there for the ambiance, go right ahead, but don't go there with the assumption that you will receive a decent cup of coffee.

A big name chef lending his name to a sports bar/sports book in the Palazzo...what could be better?  Lagasse's Stadium is a huge, multi-level sports bar cum sports book with HD large screen flat-panels dispersed liberally around the establishment.  It offers a full service bar and menu with the usual bar food suspects, presumably with the Emeril \\\"\"bam!\\\"\"   Lagasse's Stadium has plenty of table seating as well as lounge seating with a personal HD flat-panel for your area.  We elected to sit in a lounge for our semi-private viewing of the game. \\n\\nAs a venue to watch your game goes, Lagasse's Stadium is first-rate.  Sadly, where it falls way short is the one place you'd think it would be nailed down tight, the food.  We started off on a good foot with the Tuna Poke Chips appetizer ($15).  The diced Ahi tuna and avocado were fresh tossed in a ponzu vinaigrette and served atop crispy wonton chips which were drizzled with a spicy Chinese mustard.  It came with a small wakame salad on the side.  The app was flavorful without being overdressed with the vinaigrette.  The only negative was the $15 price for the amount received.  However, after our app, the wheels fell off of the chuck wagon.  My dad and I ordered Oyster Po Boy ($16) sandwiches.  Both of our po boys came with what should've been four large-sized, fried oysters on New Orleans-style French Bread with lettuce, tomato and Creole mayonnaise.  Sadly, our oysters were deep-fried into submission leaving only a slightly burnt flavored batter and sad, desiccated oysters within.  I've been to New Orleans.  I know Emeril has been there, too.  No way would he ever mistake these poorly executed excuses for authentic Po Boys.  Lagasse's Stadium delivered something that was practically worthless at twice the price of what a po boy could be found in New Orleans.  My mom ordered the Fish and Chips ($15).  Yet again, the kitchen failed to properly execute the dish.  The beer-battered cod was nicely fried and not too greasy, but the fried fish was way over salted to the point of being inedible.  Not even alcohol could overcome the food fail since Lagasse's Stadium's beer and spirits selection was entirely lackluster.  If I'm going to pay a premium price for a drink to wash down the overpriced, poorly executed food, then you should have something premium on your drink menu.  At least our server was personable, attentive, but not intrusive.  The service and the fact that IU beat Georgia were about the only positives of our visit. \\n\\nEmeril, if you're going to lend your well-respected name in the culinary world to any establishment, even if it's only a sports bar on steroids, then you should make sure the bar food that they serve meets your same minimum standards that you'd require at Delmonico, Table 10, or your eponymous Emeril's Fish House.

I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine- which promptly came in a dirty glass complete with a lip imprint!  The waitress apologized and then announced she was the only server in the whole restaurant and the place was full!  She also mentioned that they started their new menu last night and she had no idea what was on it.

That is the taste.\\\"\"\\n\\nReally? The brewery makes beer that tastes rotten and stale? Interesting concept.\\n\\nThey did not offer a new beer. They did not offer a different beer. They did not offer to remove the beers from the check.

Why should I have to *ask* for the wine list? Strike two.\\n\\nRenee did not go over any of the specials with us. He also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. So when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.\\n\\nThe assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw Renee once again (with the bill). The assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.\\n\\nThis wasn't turning out to be the pampered, high-quality service that I had come to expect based on my experiences at other fine dining establishments.\\n\\nOur food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly.

Both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. Both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThe sides left much to be desired. Many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. The broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. The potato gratin contained too much garlic.\\n\\nThe speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast.

I've gotten to the point that I feel that I'm getting a little uppity about what I expect in a caffeine shack that I'm going to be sitting, wholly immobile except for my eyes, for hours at a time.  Realistically, I can deal with blah service.  I can deal with less than amazing coffee.  I can even deal with a little bit of a mess.  But there are two things about this starbucks that absolutely drive me nuts.\\n\\nFirst off, the place constantly looks dirty.  And I mean dirty to the point that I'd prefer to not put my book bag down because I'm worried what it might come into contact with while it's down there.\\n\\nSecondly, the place has either the most powerful AC unit in AZ or it's completely possessed.  There are constant waves of hot, then cold, air that pass through this place.  You have to take your sweater on and then off again in the space of 5 minutes.  A deal breaker?  No.  Annoying as all get out?  Very much so.", "thought I would come here again just to see if things have changed...nope, employees are still SMOKING right outside in the patio area...who the hell likes second hand smoke wafting all around your face...especially if it make you gag?

I love different ethnic food and honestly their menu was still a little too authentic for me - and from what I got not healthy and not all that good. I ordered a chicken lemongrass bowl.

The drinks were okay here, however the service was subpar.  After ordering our drinks, the barista making the drinks kind of just nonchalantly shoved our drinks out on the counter didn't call out the order or our names.  I still said thank you and the barista just looked at me, walked away, and didn't say a single word back...okay?

The flatbread sandwich was dripping with some kind of weird honey dressing and she only gave me one napkin that was already soaked from the sauce leaking. The banana was beat up and bruised and the smoothie was the thickest drink I've ever had. Literally brick hard! There was no way to possibly consume this smoothie through a straw so I was forced to eat it with a spoon.\\n\\nOverall, DO NOT EVER EVER EVER visit this location unless you want to or have $10 to throw away on a lunch break.

The variety of food is plenty, but quality is lacking in flavor and preparation.  It was a half-assed attempt of a Vegas-style buffet menu and definitely not worth the price.  Stay far, far away from the sushi.  Disgusting.  Put it this way--all of the 'fresh' seafood selection was waterlogged and plain--even the butter couldn't  help, but according to other reviews, this Is the place.  If you say so, but my taste buds were crying for mercy.  My attempt of trying the oysters was foiled by other patrons rummaging through them like pig slop and based on their facial expressions--no thanks.

I call up the night of going there to see if a reservation was needed.  They tell me they always suggest a reservation....so i proceed to see if they have anytime available for 8 o clock that evening.  They do...Great!!  I head over to Sutra which is the \\\"\"new\\\"\" sushi place to go to in scottsdale.  Excited to try some new sushi in town we walk in to an 80% empty restaurant wondering why they suggested we make a reservation??  The restaurant looked identical to the previous lounge that occupied this space, La Rouge.  There were minimal changes and the same furniture remained which i thought was disappointing.  I thought they would have given Sutra its own identity.  They might as well had called it La Rouge and told people they now serve sushi.  The next disappointing thing about Sutra was the service....BRU-TAL!!  Im talking painful to sit through.  The waitress came over and introduced herself and asked if we wanted drinks.  We wanted to see their wine list along with the martini list.  She had to make two seperate trips to find both of these menus.  Finally she delivered the menus to us as if they were the only menus in the restaurant and we were lucky to have received them.  Then, after looking over the sushi menu for 20 minutes and finally deciding on what we wanted, the waitress came over to look over our order and make sure she was aware of everything we wanted.  After she looked it over she asks, \\\"\":Oh, did they tell you what the deal was tonight??\\\"\"  We all looked at each other and said, \\\"\"No, whats the deal here tonight?'  She says, \\\"\"We are not serving any hot food tonight and any of the sushi that contains tempura (a fried breading) is not available, however, edamame and miso soup are still available.  Hmmm....\\\"\"Why didnt they mention that when i made a reservation\\\"\" I pondered.  And why didnt the server mention this the first three times she visited our table for that matter.  Half the items that we ordered were immediatly eliminated and we had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what we wanted.  Finally, we decide and the waitress takes our order.  As the night progressed the service and experience just got more interesting.  The food was brought out by runners and the waitress had no clue what had been brought out and what hadnt.  She was asking US what still needed to come out.  Kinda weird...thought that was her responsibility to know what still needed to come out??  So after eating a few mediocre rolls of sushi we all decided that we were full and couldnt eat anymore.  We asked the server to cancel the last two dishes that hadnt arrived yet.  She looked at us like we were from Mars and said, \\\"\"Oh, you guys didnt get everything?\\\"\"  She canceled the remaining dishes and proceeded to talk to us for literally a half hour.  \\\"\"About what\\\"\" you are wondering.  I have no clue...all i know is that i felt 1000 times dumber after she was done.  So, I think you get the idea.  This place should live about as long as La Rouge did...and hopefully not that long.  This was a painful dining experience.  Very disappointing coming from the people that own Barcelona and Danny's car washes.  This dinner was more annoying than the guys at the car washes that ask you if you want your windshield repaired everytime you go to fill up!

My tech was nice but sadly I didnt notice that there are bits and pieces of the previous blue shooting through my newly applied nude polish on almost every finger. Also I felt really bad for the techs because there were 2 very very picky difficult customers they were dealing with and a lady who seemed to be the manager was a bit rough with the girls at the front desk although they were nice.

While the decor was very nice and clean, my nail technician was super chatty about herself.  That would have been okay if she had done a decent job on my nails.  My pedicure was okay, but I've had much better for cheaper.  The manicure was terrible.  I had streaks where the color was wiped off when she cleaned them with the final cleanser and she painted them with so much nail showing that it looked like my brand-new manicure was already 2 wks old.

Each time he promised to pay me by a certain day, which came and went without his promise being kept.

You guessed it.  \\n\\nWhen I approached him and introduced myself, he didn't seem to have a clue that I was one of the photographers he hired (I had never actually met him in person).  After I refreshed his memory I politely, but sternly, demanded to know when payment was going to be made.

After that day came and went, I realized he was never intending on paying me at all.  \\n\\nHaving few options, I sent a demand letter to his business address.  It has, since, been returned in the mail.

It makes me wonder if he is even a photographer, at all, or if he just uses other photographers' photos for his website.  What's even more sickening is that he is going to bridal expos and posting deals online to gain more business.  The fact that he could look me in the face and lie without hesitating disgusts me.\\n\\nThough I am naturally incensed about not having been paid for working an eight hour day on my feet in the heat (and spending money on additional equipment figuring I was making that money back), it infuriates me more that he is stealing such a special day from so many couples.  \\n\\nMy advice to everyone who has been burned by this con artist is to take legal action immediately!

We went earlier in the day just so we could know where in the mall it was located. I'm glad we did since it was off a corridor from the main forum shops. We liked how the place looked. Well set up and inviting. They had a long row of outside tables in front of the restaurant. \\n\\nSo we go to the place and they found our reservation and went to seat us. They brought us into the bar and sat us in the corner with a view of the strip. I didn't mind the view but if I made reservations why was I sitting at the bar? Kinda of set the mode already. It was not to crowded for a Friday night which we were very surprised when most restaurants are hopping. There were bread stick on the table already but they were prepackaged ones and not from Italy, they were made in New Jersey. \\n\\nWe wanted the best from Buddy so my wife ordered his wife's linguine and clam sauce. While I had Buddy's chicken rigatoni \\\"\"ALLA VODKA\\\"\". My wife's meal was plain and not worth the $26 that they charged for it. It tasted like my wife made it herself nothing fancy or fantastic taste. Mine had maybe 6 pieces of chicken in it and the pasta was kind of chewy. It was like my wife made it also. Not saying I wouldn't eat it but not real fine dining. We have been to several restaurants in Vegas since we go 4-6 times a year. So I'm no newbie. \\n\\nOh I missed the garlic bread we ordered before the meal. Which consisted of three pieces for 9. Nothing special and little over priced again.

It would be totally packed everyday if the prices were lower and family orientated. \\n\\nBut not to jam on Buddy over his place.

Can't be, the outside of the place looks like Pizza Hut meets Red Lobster (circa 1978).\\nIs it the decor? Not unless you get awards for a Bass Pro Shops Cracker Barrel (or TGI Fridays) mash up.\\nWas it the hostess? Maybe, we were greeted promptly and immediately offered a booth in the bar. When I declined and said we preferred a table, we were led to the opposite side of the building and offered a table there; instead of the one I had been standing six inches from when the booth was offered. Sooooo, not the hostessing either.\\nI know, the menu, Dave's is famous for the menu, looks good, tries to promote the food and is laid out well......wait, that last one is a lie.....Not the menu.\\nHmmmmm.......this is allegedly a restaurant, so maybe, just maybe, it's the food Dave's is so rightly famous for! Alas, no.\\nThe food is abysmal and miserable to put it kindly.\\nMy wife and I each ordered the two meat lunch special, which is your choice of two meat like substances and a single side item. Now, for a mere $2.49 you can order an additional side item; which I gamely did as most places have decent side items, especially BBQ joints. Well, was I in for a surprise, unfortunately. I asked for the ribs and brisket with fries and cole-slaw. What red-blooded American wouldn't love that?\\nUnfortunately, that would be this one. What I got was teriyaki beef jerky disguised as brisket and TWO, count them, TWO measly ribs. The brisket was probably cooked correctly at some point in it's life, but by the time it was presented to me, it was no longer identifiable. But, I was hungry, and my jaws needed the circuit training, so I chewed, come to think of it, it's two hours later and I am still chewing on at least one piece. The ribs were greasy, in the name of all that is holy in smoking, how in the hell do you make ribs greasy? Famous Dave's staff wear shirts with cute little slogans, like \\\"\"Good BBQ is all smoke and beers\\\"\", I have news, they think enough beers are going to cover up the lack of good smoke. While I am talking about my lunch, let me also touch on the slaw, don't; just don't. The \\\"\"fries\\\"\" were edible, if unseasoned in any way. I tried all of the sauces, hoping something would improve this Rocky Horror BBQ show on my plate, but I can't stress how bad they were. I seriously think they bought the cheapest BBQ like stuff they could find at food4less or some other high quality dings and dents grocers and put just enough habanero sauce in it to call something else. I have received better BBQ sauces from Del Taco for chicken fingers. Then when I thought things couldn't get any worse, I looked to see what chicanery they had pulled on my blushing bride celebrating the glories of her own birth. She had gamely ordered the chicken, brisket, slaw, and mashed potatoes. Her description of the chicken to me was, \\\"\"Not bad, it's edible\\\"\" Wow, that is a screaming endorsement, someone call the papers! (Please note the sarcasm filter). She also received the beef jerky. When our waitress ( think Olive Oyl with the voice of Minnie Mouse) asked my blushing bride how our food was, my demur wife said to Minnie,\\\"\"the brisket is tough and dry.\\\"\" To which Minnie emoted dismayed shock and offered my wife some Au Jus (pronounced Awe Juice) to remedy the situation. My wife agreed, while I sat there scratching my head trying to figure out what the hell just happened.\\nAbout 8 minutes later, the Awe Juice arrived, it was warmer than the meat at this point, and my wife tried to soften the leather on her plate to no avail. She wound up giving it to the dog (me) to eat. When Minnie finally came back, she said she was sorry my wife didn't like trying to eat leather and offered her something else. (The only reason I know she apologized was because I had CC on for the hearing impaired). My wife declined the offer of more ruined meat byproducts and instead turned her attention to her sides, the slaw and the mashed potatoes. The slaw received a hearty \\\"\"meh\\\"\" but had the distinction of being edible and almost palatable. All of our hopes now rested on the mashed potatoes, and were about to be dashed. Mash potatoes are not known for being overly flavorful, but no flavor at all? I could have saved over $30.00 and dined on glue stix by Elmer's.\\nSo, if not the architecture, the decor, the welcome, the food, or the service, then just what in the hell is Dave's famous for?", "Horrible service.

Taste isn't the best but isn't as bad as some spots I've been to. I am not a smoker so being around smoke while trying to enjoy the meal is NOT ideal. Although I may not look it, I am a BIG eater, lol, so small servings don't cut it for me.\\n\\nOverall, I would not come back nor would I recommend but if you're rich and don't really know sushi, this is your spot. Otherwise, sorry to be a bubble popper. :[", "Can't get rid of robocalls from the Service Department\\n\\nI bought my Subaru in 2010 and was reasonably satisfied with the transaction, though it took 3 days to get the car I wanted. Everyone was polite, which I attribute to the fact that I was buying through Costco. They sent me coupons for the first couple of maintenance intervals, which I appreciated. Then, instead of a coupon, I started getting automated phone calls reminding me that it was time to get the car serviced. \\n\\nThis was especially bad after the 30,000 mile service, because it's an expensive one. I got it done for $400 at Gab's (all genuine Subaru parts) instead of $600 at Camelback Subaru. I told them it had been done and asked them to have me taken off the robocall list. They didn't.\\n\\nIt's not every day but it's often enough to be annoying.  Starts to feel like harassment after awhile.", "Went for a standard mani-pedi.  It was pretty busy but they got me in right away. They seemed very distracted and my nail tech was halfway through my pedicure before she asked if I wanted a manicure also. It was also difficult to understand them, but thats common. Then halfway through my manicure she left for another client and had to have another tech finish my nails. This was very inconvenient as they had to split my bill between the two techs on two separate transactions and I had to figure out how much to tip each one... Ended up costing about $50. The end result was pretty standard although it started wearing off after two days. Afterward, I tried to buy the nail color for touch ups and learned that the color was discontinued in 2007, which is kind if disturbing to have them use 6 year old polish. Then a few days later a couple of my fingernails started hurting... Yep, they are infected... But only the nails the second tech worked on. Which makes me think it may not have happened if they hadn't switched techs on me. I've had many manicures in my life and this is the first place I ever got infection from.  Definitely won't be returning here. There are many places around town that look cleaner, are less crowded, pay more attention to clients and are cheaper.", "Very disappointed...calamari was salty & Cesar salad had a bottle dressing not good. Overall food was average not worth the premium price!!!", "If you want a very average burger, with a nice big stinking pile of AWFUL customer service on the side, this is your Burger King location.

At least until the staff is entirely replaced or retrained. Rude, disengaged, curt, and bitter. To the customers and very obviously to each other too. Most unimpressive cashiers ever. Some of the worst customer service in Charlotte NC. Period.", "I don't think so.  Maybe for little kids to drain some of their energy, but definitely not an adult activity.  Way too much money for what it is...not good.", "Haven't been here in years, but decided to revisit.\\n\\nService was slow - took forever to get someone to even approach the table and the place was not crowded at all.\\n\\nFood was fair at best.  My son's chicken parm was not warm throughout and had to be taken back.  Pasta dishes were ok, but nothing to write home about...sauces were lacking.  There are much better places.\\n\\nSorry, gotta tell it like it is.  We won't be going back.  It's a shame because they could really play off of the 'authentic' Italian thing, but it's just not happening.  The best thing we enjoyed about our visit was the warm breadsticks with marinara.", "This place is terrible. I do not recommend going here for a car wash. We found them through Groupon. We paid $30 for a wax, car and mat wash. They were streaks up the ying yang. For that price, I could've got better service with the mobile retailers that come to my place of employment. We thought we got a deal, instead we got ripped off. I suggest going to a car wash spot that has really good reviews instead of one that doesn't have one. I sure learned my lesson.", "Staff was ok except one. Went there during lunch hour and as we are getting ready to prepare our bowl. one of the members of their staff yells at me with an attitude \\\"\" you cant be back here\\\"\" what she is talking about the area between the 2 self serve veggie/ meat station. One bar was closed but with all the respect it is hard to reach to an item that is way in the back so I went to the other side to make it easier to reach and this girl yells at me from across instead of coming closer to me and warning me it is not allowed to be on the other side. How rude! what is ur location's goal here? go big or go home! I wont be visiting again.", "I am so completely disappointed in the vet and staff. \\n\\nMy dog, Bob was not properly diagnosed, calls to the Vet were not returned and they just really didn't care.\\n\\nWhen I asked if they were familiar with glucose testing I could do at home, they were clueless.\\n\\nI asked the right questions. I believed them in them, what a mistake that was.\\n\\nNow, Bob is gone. He suffered and he didn't have to.\\n\\nI have to live with that guilt for the rest of my life. \\n\\nWhen I called them to get my other dog's records, they didn't even ask about Bob.\\n\\nI was there with him almost every week for 2 months and spent well over $5000.\\n\\nShame on all of you.

Lots of negatives, no table settings,no water provided, took 15 min for maltas to be brought and we had to ask for them,the server very young and clueless, the Cuban sandwich a big disappointment,bread hard and flat,drye.

After showing them a tracking number and even finding the name of the person who signed confirming delivery, instead of trying to locate my items, the assistant manager insisted that fed ex was wrong and my equipment never arrived. \\n\\nThen after calling shipping  to verify my facts, I was basically told that those people must also be 'wrong'. I would have appreciated either an offer of a refund, or an attempt to locate my merchandise. Not the insistence that every bit of verification I was able to show must somehow be wrong.", "The worst customer service ever. We bought a washer and dryer there, heard nothing for two weeks, then randomly got a phone call saying they would deliver around noon that day. Thanks for the heads up!? I was at work and noon was about twenty minutes away, so obviously couldn't just leave my job in the middle of the day. I asked for them to come the next day (saturday), they gave me a four hour time window telling us we would get a call between 8-12.  They randomly showed up around 1:45, this is after I called the store at noon to check on where they were. We waited around and wasted our entire Saturday. When they arrived and did the install the dryer wouldn't turn on. They said it was our breaker. We had an electrician come out and basically pain him to tell us nothing was wrong and they must have hooked the dryer up incorrectly. Called them back to get someone out, they were supposed to come yesterday and canceled on us, and no showed on us today. We paid a ridiculous amount of money to have a washer and dryer just sitting in our house. They have beyond wasted our time. This is literally only the tip of the iceberg of our experience and doesn't even cover the times we have called and not gotten called back and the fact that when you do call they answer the phone as if it's their house phone. Seriously annoyed and will never buy anything from lowes again.", "Ordered McFlurrys through the drive thru. Paid at the window and was handed the McFlurrys not mixed. I handed them back to the guy and said they need to be mixed. He said they couldn't mix it. Really mcdonalds??? Why even sell them? Or why not tell the person at the order point about it. Major fail.

We tried the red sangria and it was the worst sangria that I had ever. You may drink a bottled beer and enjoy your life without worrying about the taste.", "I think it really depends on when you go, hence the 2 instead of 3 stars. Some days they have some great stuff, other days not so much, & they can run a bit high. When it comes to selling, no you won't get what YOU think it's worth. But hey they're a business they gotta make money. My biggest gripe about the selling process is that standards seem to vary on who's checking it in. I used to work at a similar establishment, & that happened a lot. It's a little hipster for my taste. But I enjoy a good deal, when I can find one here. As far as \\\"\"vintage\\\"\" stuff goes, save your money & hit the thrift stores with a keen eye.", "Worst service ever. Walked in today asked for 4 top and told the wait was 35 minutes.

It's my kid's favorite restaurant.  I went in on July 4th and half way through my meal I noticed a cockroach on my plate.  Laying right under my carnitas.  I was pretty close to tears in the restaurant.  I will never return to this location again. I may go to the Camelback location again after I get over the trauma.  But this was one of the worst experiences of my life.", "One star is way too high a rating for this place.  It might be cheap, but it is not worth the saved cash.  Stayed there on business.  My first night there they placed me in a room on the strip.  \\nFirst problem was that the wi-fi did not work.  How do I do business with without wi-fi?  Second problem was the 80's band cranking right outside my window. \\nIn th morning I asked for another room.  This room was better, but but still damp, plain, old, ugly, dark, and a maze to get to.  That night I came back to my room, but the key didn't work.  After several trips to the front desk they had to get security to let me in.  \\nThis place is a disaster plain and simple.  The casino smells like an old Chinese restaurant and the rooms are putrid.  Even the elevators are slow and rusty.  Price and location are not enough to justify the Imperial Palace.", "I love great steak. I'm a big steakhouse fan. This is about the worst steakhouse I've ever been to. It's not because the food is so-so, but the service was worse than abysmal. This is a restaurant in serious need of training from the top down. The top here may or may not be Jean Georges, but there is some serious attitude training needed. The obvious aim was to be pretentious, which is never a good thing. But if you're going to be pretentious, then you'd better be able to back it up with stellar service. They didn't and couldn't. First the food.\\n\\nThe steak was so-so. My dining partner and I were going to split the small rib-eye, which was listed as an 18 oz. portion of prime beef. It came to the table a little small for its purported weight, which wasn't the problem. It was an OK rib-eye, but lacked flavor for a $45+ piece of steak. We also had a Caesar salad, which was good, but not great. Nice preparation with delicious anchovies on top. Couldn't fault that. We also ordered some Brussels sprouts, which were nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. It came with walnuts and avocado, an unusual preparation, but delicious. \\n\\nThe wine list was inaccurate as well. A shiraz from Barossa (I'd been to the winery) was listed as being from New Zealand! About 3,000 miles away from South Australia and Barossa. It was kind of, but not very, cool that the wine list came on an iPad, but they would have been better served by using paper. I understand the concept, but not the execution.\\n \\nNo. While the food and wine was OK, even if way overpriced, the waitstaff and manager were the problem. And the problem was huge. First the waiter. There are ways a waiter can suss out what kind of knowledge the diner has about a product being presented. In this case, since I owned a restaurant once, I was very knowledgeable about beef. The waiter approached us as noobs who knew nothing. The meal came all divided up, but not well. The dishes were cleared away in such a manner that it appeared that they couldn't wait for us to leave. Plates and utensils were snapped up. As we finished our meal, the bus person came by and started clearing the table with a lot of clanking and jerked the place mat from under a drinking glass like a magician. It made a loud noise and seemed very rude. He ignored us when I told him to stop. Then I was angry.\\n\\nThe manager came by and asked if there was a problem, then proceeded to be a automaton, \\\"\"Yes sir.\\\"\" \\\"\"Yes sir.\\\"\" \\\"\"Yes sir.\\\"\" \\\"\"Yes sir.\\\"\" \\\"\"Yes sir.\\\"\" \\\"\"Yes sir.\\\"\" without hearing a word I said. Of course this was even more upsetting and condescending to us as diners who were paying a great deal of money for a mediocre meal. This man as a manager is in serious need of training or another profession.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, we left a very small tip. The waiter was OK. The manager was not. The only thing he did well was come to the table.\\n\\nIf you want a really good steak and good service that doesn't condescend, go across the street to Smith & Wollensky. Don't let your shadow fall on this place. I realize that this little diatribe won't make much difference because Jean Georges is located in the Aria hotel, so they get a huge captive audience, but I will be in Vegas again and I will go somewhere else. STAY AWAY from Jean Georges!", "Pros: Chips, Guac, and Salsa\\n\\nCons: Average, uninspired entrees, and a customer unfriendly reservation policy. Even if you make a reservation and follow their rules on when exactly to arrive (11:45 AM) they won't seat you until all of your party arrives. This would be okay if there was room to sit or stand comfortably in the main part of the restaurant, but there's not. It was annoying to see other people without reservations seated while we were squashed against a wall. If we were offered seats at the bar right away, that would have been slightly better, but it didn't occur to anyone to do that until 10 minutes later and our full party had arrived. Poor customer service.", "Everything in Las Vegas is a cartoon version of something else, something far away. Just like how New York New York is a cartoon metropolis; The Beat Coffeehouse is a cartoon version of a San Francisco beatnik coffeeshop from the 60s. The difference being the lack of effort put into the latter.\\n\\nI walked in, took a seat at the counter, and waited for a few minutes without getting so much as eye contact from the staff, who were obsessing over which insanely cliche Ramones vynil to play. I think they were trying to figure out whether any of their albums was in an Apple commercial, so they could play that one.\\n\\nAfter several minutes, I was able to order a macchiato. The barista sighed and said, \\\"\"We don't have those.\\\"\"\\n\\n\\\"\"You don't have espresso and frothed milk?\\\"\"\\n\\n\\\"\"Yeah, but we don't have macchiatos.\\\"\"\\n\\n\\\"\"OK, can you make me a shot of espresso?\\\"\"\\n\\n\\\"\"Yes.\\\"\"\\n\\n\\\"\"Then can you froth some milk and put a spoonful over it.\\\"\"\\n\\n\\\"\"Yes.\\\"\"\\n\\n\\\"\"That's a macchiato.\\\"\"\\n\\nSome coffeehouse. I'm still not sure whether the barista genuinely didn't know what a macchiato is, or was kind of assholishly trying to tell me that they don't make Starbucks' bastardized version of the Italian standard. Neither would surprise me, as the espresso was weak yet overroasted.\\n\\nFortunately, when my chicken caesar wrap finally arrived, it was actually pretty good. One generous star for that.", "We went here for dinner about a month ago. \\n\\nWe had the samosa chat for an app (cubed samosa with yogurt and mint sauce). It was good but I'd probably try something different next time. Seems like it's made out of leftover samosas.\\n\\nWe also got raita which was good but a little tarter than I like. The garlic naan was yummy. \\n\\nFor main courses we had prawn biriyani and mateer paneer. The prawn biriyani was tasty though the rice was on the al dente side. The matter paneer had a nice sauce. \\n\\nThe dinner was good overall, but there are better Indian restaurants in town.", "I stayed here with my teenage daughters for spring break 2013.   The room in Tower II was ok with the 2 queen beds.  One of the sheets on top of the bed had a blood stain on it.  A light bulb in the bathroom was out.  The soaps are cheap.  The smell in the hotel and casino is really bad.  The people working at registration are un-friendly.  \\nThey misrepresent the true cost for the rooms.  There are extra fees for internet and \\\"\"resort\\\"\" fees that are unexplained.  There is an internet fee that we could not use since we didn't bring our \\\"\"ethernet cable\\\"\" with us when we were expecting WiFi.  This is 2013, correct??   Dicks restaurant, located on the pathway between the hotel and the rooms, has terrible and expensive food, charges between $5 and $10 for a regular drink, and the waiter, if you can call him that, regularly liked to play with his crotch.  I guess he thought that was comical or entertaining.    About the pools.  The music they play on their speakers are very, very loud and annoying.  The rules on what you can and cannot bring into the pool are inconsistent and ridiculous.  Why we cannot bring a bottle of water into the pool area is beyond me.

This is a health hazard to say the least.  \\n\\nNext time I'm going to a hotel that is honest, clean and provides what you pay for.", "It is very unfortunate that there is only ONE Colombian restaurant in Las Vegas, and this one is not a good example of our gastronomy.

During the day, you order at the counter and seat yourself, which I don't mind. But I always have to wait WAY too long, and often don't get what I happened to order (this happened today, when I ordered a large latte, got a regular, which is tiny BTW, and when I asked about it I was made to feel like I had made the mistake, instead of someone just offering to fix it). During the evening, you are waited on, but both times I've been here for dinner, it has been nearly impossible to get food, drink, and bill in a timely manner. \\n\\nMy other gripe is that the food is overpriced. I like some of the food (the pretzel appetizer is awesome), but most of it is smaller than you'd expect (e.g., the asian chicken salad) and definitely more than you'd like to pay for it. \\n\\nIt's too bad, because it's near my house and I love the concept and decor. Alas, for coffee I love Lola and Giant about 1,000 times more, and there is obviously better food nearby.", "I was at Venetian Hotel at 1 month ago, and my camera was stolen inside the hotel. It is a very experience camera and I ask for the help. The security department of the hotel said they didn't see any camera, than I asked that I they can check the security camera record to find the thief, but they refused. That time, my heart was broken because of the lost camera, it was my everything.  It feels like the hotel really doesn't care their customer's proper, they ask interested in make money.", "I go through dessert phases - donuts, cupcakes, ice cream, yogurt.....for the past couple months it's been cookies. I love finding local bakeries (via Yelp of course) and checking out their cookie selection, which is exactly how I found myself at Dainty Cakes a couple weeks ago. The shop itself is really cute and actually has tables inside where some patrons were sitting reading the paper and enjoying their coffee and baked goods. Plus, best I can tell, it's owned by a husband and wife team who provided friendly service. Looking good so far. The selection of cookies wasn't the best, probably had about 10 different kinds in the case, and only one fruity variety (lemon). However, they did have macaroons, which I love, so I was still excited to pick out some delicious desserts. You can do a box of cookies here, but there is no box price, you still pay per cookie, which is almost $2 each (high!). I sampled the lemon, the macaroon, sugar, peanut butter sandwich, oatmeal sandwich, Russian tea (which I've always called Mexican Wedding), and shortbread. Now, I love cookies, and I'm not super picky. Fact is, I can destroy a box of those soft iced sugar cookies you can get in holiday colors at Walmart. Unfortunately, I would rather have had a box of those sugar cookies at 1/4 the price of Dainty Cakes! The macaroon was really good, the lemon was so-so, and I just didn't really like anything else. Worst of all were the Russian, sugar, and shortbread. All were insanely bland and floury. Glad I tried it, but I won't be back.", "we wanted to make reservations, but that's done by the answering machine. We did however have reservations when we arrived. One good thing.\\n\\nThe ad said half-price drinks, wine and appetizers during happy hour, which is 4 to 6. We arrived at 5:15 and were met by a very gracious hostess. We informed her we were going to the bar to partake of the happy hour specials and for her to  find us at six o'clock for our table to which she agreed. We ordered a bloody Mary and a glass of white wine, the crab cocktail and an order of hot wings. 25 minutes later we received our appetizers. I was unable to eat the wings. They were like rubber. The bartender did remove the eight dollars from the bill for the eight wings. The rest of it came to $30.92 with tax. I was informed at that point by the bartender that none of the items ordered were included in the happy hour prices. Upon entering I asked the hostess if we could transfer our bar tab to our dining tab. She informed we could. The bartender informed us we can only transfer our drink costs to the dining room.\\nOur server was outstanding. He brought water and warm bread with butter immediately. We each ordered the 14 ounce ribeye rare with baked potato. I was unable to cut the bottom of my potato skin with a steak knife, it was so hard. The potatoes were wrapped in foil which steams the potato. I don't care for that, some people do. The steak had a good flavor but a great deal of fat and grizzle.I enjoy it with the three small button mushrooms.\\nUpon leaving, I attempted to voice my concerns with the hostess. She was completely uninterested. \\nI am a retired chef of many years. Included in several of those years I was president of the restaurant chain that covered the whole US.

The employees are lovely people. Unfortunately, I have had nothing but inconvenience working with them.\\n\\nOver the summer, my dog was playing too rough outside and head-butted our sliding glass door, causing a large spider crack that I haven't had the money to fix until recently. In September, I called Kelly's Glass and Mirror Co, which never took my calls and never returned my messages. At the start of this month, I called Davis because the reviews were so stellar, gave them the dimensions of the door, and was quoted somewhere around $270 for the repair. \\n\\nThat Wednesday (October 8), someone came to look at the door and told me that the glass would need to be specially ordered and couldn't be fixed that day. I was quoted a new price of $400 and gave my credit card for a deposit. The repairman told me that it would take three days for the glass to come in and that I would be called when it had been received by Davis.\\n\\nTen days later, I finally received a call from the company and made an appointment for Friday morning (I teach until 3 and lead an after school activity, so both morning and afternoon appointments are difficult to maneuver).

There are two doors, two counters that appear to be where one should order, and no signs or hostess directing anyone where to begin. Walking up to the counter in plain view, it was tough to get attention, so I imagine it would have been even harder to get waited on if we took a seat first. The only available tables in the place were unbussed, so we had to wait about ten minutes for that. We weren't given a menu, weren't offered drinks with our order, and had to flag down servers twice to get a bill. There seemed to be a lot of hipster jerks hanging around eyeballing us, but that goes for any vegan place or sushi joint. So - the service was awwwful and the ordering procedure was confusing.

Now I feel like a sucker. The yellow rice was under cooked, the beans were to many. The order taker made a sloppy wet burrito and backdoored a dollar. The kitchen floor needed to be cleaned.

We went for a friend's birthday.  Each paid $20 cover, not sure why (Saturday night, no holiday).  The front bar was dark.  Bar tenders gave love to regulars and sort of ignored everyone else.  Drag show was a literal drag.  They had one MC and two rotating queens doing numbers.  The blonde chic was actually nice out in the courtyard after the show, which is rare for drag queens around these parts.  Drinks were overpriced and the bar staff was a little creepy, suites and all.  Felt as if the Secret Service was in the house.  I wouldn't go back, especially to pay $20 to get in.  Retarded.", "My daughters wedding was Saturday 10/4 and we paid in full prior to the event. The limousine service picked up the groom and his groomsmen on time, but failed to return to pick up the scheduled pick-up of the bride and her bridesmaids. My daughter was late to her own wedding  because Presidential failed to follow the directions given to them. We had to have the hotel limousine service drive the bride and her party to the venue in an SUV. After that mess up Presidential confirmed they would pick up the groom and bride at 9:30 after the wedding. They even sent us a confirmation email at 6:15pm that they would be there. Once again, they did not pick up the bride and groom and we did not receive a phone call. The wedding was Saturday and we have not recieved a refund and haven't received a return call from management. It's extremely disappointing that they have our $ for all services but no services were rendered. If you want a reliable company for your wedding, DON'T USE PRESENTIAL LIMOUSINE!", "Absolutely horrible experience after MANY positive experiences.  I am not sure if they changed ownership, but I could have arguably just had the worst pedicure/manicure of my life.  If you are going to do a bad job because you do not have a lot skill, that is one thing, but my tech could have cared less about doing a good job.  LAZY, expensive and we waited almost 30 minutes just to get in.  This will be my last time here.", "I have been a season pass holder for the last 3 years. At first, it was a huge benefit but now, I feel as if those who buy groupons and living socials are more of a benefit to this establishment. \\nI went to the park yesterday 7/27 only to stand in line for 45 minutes before the park opened because they now open at 11 and not 10 anymore. I then had a group of people cut in front of me with all their coupons. \\nThe park was EXTREMELY over crowded. I saw multiple children walk out of the wave pool with BLOODY NOSES. where are the life guards. Also...when are rafts going to be free?  People pay good money only to have them STOLEN!\\nAlso, is a swimsuit not needed any longer? My reason for asking is because I saw many people wearing street clothing in the wave pool. This includes denim shorts, white tank tops with bras and the list goes on. This is posted on your website as well as at the entrance. \\nI would NOT recommend getting a season pass as there is virtually no benefit! \\nTotally disappointed", "We came here for lunch, lured by the healthy, fresh, aspect of the food here. The menu includes sandwiches, salads, and soups. You can also substitute the ingredients in any sandwich into a wrap. \\n\\nThe main problem here is the painstakingly slow service to get our food. We each ordered salads, mainly because we thought that would be the easiest item for the chefs to make. We ordered around 12:10-12:15, and had an excruciating wait for our food, which did not come all at the same time. My order came last, at 12:45, leaving me only a few minutes to eat before we had to get back to work at 1 P.M. 30 minutes to make a simple salad? Really?\\n\\nWhen I actually got my salad, it was a fairly sizable portion. I had the roasted beet salad ($8), which included slices of roasted beets on the bottom layer, with mixed greens, candied pecans, and feta cheese. It was slightly overdressed, but overall decent. Too bad I only had a few minutes to eat it, as I tried to scarf as much down as possible in a short amount of time.\\n\\nWhile they have a Coca Cola freestyle machine here for fizzy fountain drinks, their iced tea is made separately and has to be refilled by a server. The fountain drinks come in a plastic cup you can bring back with you, as opposed to the iced tea, which comes in a glass. Due to the slow service and our need to get back to work, I wasn't able to request a to-go cup or a refill on my tea so I could take it back, while the other people who got a fountain drink instead were able to take a refill to go.\\n\\nSo if you go here, go when you aren't in a rush for time due to the long wait for your meal.", "Annoyed that the very day their new add comes out, I go to the store for 2 items and they have neither.  Nice planning, Officemax.", "My first time here.. I always go to the same salon for I reason, all the service I asked for was a trim end, wash and condition ..I am all natural no heat or relaxer. I came out with burned,dry hair. This was a month ago and I have a bad smell from the burn.. Iamb experiencing shedding on the pieces that are burned and it won't go back to my natural curl pattern which in thick coils.. The stylist only burned one side THIS Is THE WORST SERVICE", "my experience at Aria this weekend started off bad. By the end of the first night it got worse. By check out time, it became funny how awful this hotel is. \\n\\nWe arrived at Aria on a saturday at 11am. We were expecting a long check in line, but were pleasantly surprised that each check in line had only 3-4 people ahead of us. We chose a line and waited. 15 minutes went by and we did not move up one place. The front desk attendant was flipping thru an employee manual trying to help the same couple that was in the front of the line when we arrived. TERRIBLE! I moved to a different line. Another 45 minutes later, we finally got keys. We were so excited to get into the room at this point. We opened the door and i noticed a hair dryer sitting out. I said \\\"\" oh thats wierd\\\"\". Thats when i noticed PEOPLE IN THE BED! The hotel had given us room keys to another persons ROOM! this has never happened to me in my entire life, much less in vegas. When we went downstairs to complain ( still in shock), the manager did not apologize to us and actually said to me\\\"\" its fine\\\"\". I told her this was NOT fine, so she gave us a $50 dining credit.  \\n\\nother notable things:\\n1) If you have an iphone or ATT you will not get service in the entire hotel. \\n2) casino and sportsbook is very small. We chose to watch the game in our room instead of the casino because there was nowhere to sit. \\n3) Visually, the hotel is UGLY. Everything from the carpet to the uniforms they make the attendants wear is really dark and drab.\\n4) rooms are SMALL. MGM grand had bigger rooms. \\n5) the 'black out shades\\\"\" that are standard in all vegas hotel rooms do not work here. We were awoken at 8 am by light coming in thru the edges of the shades. Not cool, aria!  \\n6) the \\\"\"mall\\\"\" has approx. 2 stores open. unless you're in the market for a thousand dollar LV bag or Tiffany's jewelry just skip this mall. \\n7) we ate at ate 3 restaurants in the hotel. they were all terrible ( service and food). Really surprising since 2 of the reasons i love vegas is because there is always amazing food and service. \\n\\nThe 2nd thing that happened was after a long night out in vegas we came back to our room and the TV had been left on. We tried to turn it off, but the remote wouldnt work. there were no buttons on the tv to manually turn it off. We called the front desk 10 times before someone answered. Apparently they weren't answering because there was a \\\"\"drug issue\\\"\" in the hotel ( that is exactly what the front desk agent told us...awesome!)  They told us that the engineer would need to come up to change the batteries. 2 hours later, we got some new batteries in our remote. The engineer told us he's been replacing batteries about 30 times a day since the hotel opened. Why would a brand new hotel have old batteries in their remote?  At this point we just want to go to sleep.\\n\\nThe next morning instead of enjoying our last few hours in the hotel before check out we just decide to leave. We go to check out and there were 4 bogus charges on our hotel bill ( mini bar mostly). this was strange to us because houskeeping didnt even come while we were there! Luckily they removed those charges...... \\n\\nAll in all this hotel is terrible. it was a terrible decision for the owners to open this hotel without properly training their staff. Everything seems to be done half assed. I have absolutely zero desire to ever give this hotel another shot. With the amazing other hotels in vegas at similar price ranges ( palazzo, venetian, caesars, etc...) aria would be my LAST choice hotel.", "I'm not gonna be nice. I'd read about the comments regarding poor attitudes & customer service. Yep. Got'em both. Showed up at 2:30pm for their daily Happy Hour. Oh, of course. You have to be literally sitting at the bar on one of their 6 total bar stools. And the 10 open bar tables 2 foot away are just too much trouble.

Oy. Yes, the atmosphere is fine, and the people are pretty, and the dishes are acceptable, but... Why oh Why must the employees there be robots, automatons blindly following the company script? The server helping us must have been so new, or terrified of losing his job, that he was incapable of relying on any part of his authentic self. He was obviously told what to say to us upon approaching the table (the dreaded \\\"\"Have you been here before?\\\"\"), what to say upon 'walking us through the menu' (I have only read a menu like this 10,000 times before), what to say upon bringing each item to the table (thanks, I know what 'street' tacos look like), etc. What does Mr. Fox fear? That his employees may have a personality that may ring true to diners? That we may accidentally have a genuine interpersonal interaction, if even for 30 seconds? And it wasn't just the server. We got the same from the hostess and the manager too. It's enough to make you lose your appetite. I'm outta here. No more Sam Fox for me.", "The worst! All the staff (manager included) were just standing around talking, the floors were so slick and dirty it was hard to walk, and the bathroom was horrible. And to add a cherry on top the health score was a 92.... avoid at all cost!", "Terrible. I am cranky we wasted our time to get here for the showtime, stand with a ton of other people with no personal space and watch this crap.

So, we drive back 20 minutes to arrive at the one on the strip. Greeted (if you can call it that) by a young man, a host, who looked miserable to be there. Slumped over in a stool at the host stand. Not very welcoming and took our name. \\n\\nWe were seated after a 30 minute wait. Service was rather slow. My husband ordered the sage chicken Benedict which he said was ok.

My total was $24 something and for a 16inch 3 topping pizza it was a total rip off. \\nThe anchovies I asked for only on half the pizza ended up being 3 tiny pieces on 4 big slices of pizza, thats not even one anchovie for a slice!!! \\nAlso, mushrooms and tomatoes are not the most expensive veggies in the world and it looked as if they sliced just one mushroom and one tomatoe for a large pizza that clearly looked that these guys were trying to make money and not a quality pizza. It might be a different story if you are in the restaurant for a sit down where they cant do it to your face but for delivery they totally try to get away with being as cheap as possible and $24 dollars for a pizza shouldnt be a cheap pizza with barely anything on it, bottom line, i paid $24 dollars for a cheese pizza.", "Super boring, do not waste your time.

I loved this place because it was a great place to not run into mall-rat kids, annoying people kicking the back of your seat, all the good seats taken by people who camped out, etc etc, and to be able to watch a first rate movie in peace and comfort for a bit of a price premium. A full bar was icing on top of actually watching a movie in an experience that was as good as being at home.\\n\\nThe most crucial thing is these new anti-theft 3D glasses by Dolby are huge, uncomfortable, and most importantly very dirty and reflective (The individually wrapped Real-D ones were far better and CLEAN). After first putting a very dirty set back and grabbing a new pair they still were covered in prints, After a thorough scrubbing to try to get the obvious finger prints off of my vision I was left with a Vaseline covered goop around the corners of the screen and tunnel vision. The lights are kept fairly high so the servers can walk around, the problem is these reflective lenses gave me a very good view of my own eyeball and the lights to my periphery, further obscuring my vision of the movie. I felt like a fool but the only solution I found was to stick my movie ticket in-between the glasses and my temple creating a blinder that fixed one lens. When possible I took them off and ignored the blurry backgrounds. Double vision was better than a dim blurry mess.\\n\\nFood and drink is great... but meaningless if the movie experience is ruined.\\n\\nServers have walk-e-talkys chirping during the movie taking you out of it, their ordering system seemed to be a glowing white smartphone. Why not install a red filter on them? The color red does not affect night vision nor distract near as much. Similarly, give them red flashlights and turn the lights back down to movie levels. They are good at ducking out of the way but that doesn't solve everything.\\n\\nI won't review the food but I was dismayed to see the drink selection was no longer local microbrews like OMB Copper, but now a slew of major national names (and for some reason Sweetwater 420, yuck).\\n\\nSadly it looks like next time I will be back at a major chain with the mallrats.

I felt the $22 fee was high, but not exorbitant given they were also paying a musician. I had been informed by many that the class leader was one of their more popular. The studio was extremely warm and just a bit uncomfortable. The class was large. The instructor was very nice, but there did not seem to be any direction to the program. As a certified yoga instructor I was taught how to design and pace a class. There was none of this. Seemingly random asanas linked together with not the smoothest of transitions. In a previous review I read about the overpriced merchandise and I have no problem with that as it can easily be ignored. Mat rental? I have never heard of this before though the response from YS was that it is not unique. It is gouging nonetheless. I teach at a facility which provides mats, straps, blocks and bolsters at no additional fee. To charge would be like asking someone to bring their own weights to Gold's Gym. My suggestion to Sherry would be to get back in touch with the local yoga \\\"\"teaching\\\"\" community. Experience what is going on. Compare and contrast with your competition.

If it wasn't fat, I have no clue what it was.  And the fried rice looked something like rice, but I don't even know how to describe what it tasted like.

Before I begin, I must say that the breakfast was very tasty and the banana pancakes and pecan bars were outstanding!\\nBUT, here's what I observed this morning that can hopefully change in the near future:\\n1.  It's unclear which counter you order from at first.  The North entrance from the parking lot gets filled with a long line until one finds they could have slipped around the corner and ordered at the other registers.  2.  There's a hanging light fixture impeding the view of the hanging menu at the North entrance. Should be moved to the right.  3.  Why on earth do I have to wait 8 minutes after waiting in line to get a simple drip coffee?  Drip coffees should be out in the open next to the creams and sugar.  Instead, you have to order your coffee at the counter, receive an order number that you place on top of your table and wait for eight minutes for your waiter to give you the coffee. Then, if you want cream you have to get up from the table and go to the counter that has creams and sugars. Very tedious system for a simple cup of Joe. 4.  The English muffins on the breakfast dishes aren't toasted - or if they are, only for 5 seconds.  Not very good.  5.  I ordered the ricotta waffles on a Sunday morning and was told they ran out! That's odd that a place opened for breakfast and lunches would run out of waffle batter on a weekend morning! Wouldn't you stock the kitchen with extra ingredients or have someone run out to a store or call a vendor if you were running low? 6.  The place needed an extra pop of color other than the gray and yellow.  More green plants or single red tulips in small vases would add more warmth and charm.  7.  The Benedict -style pesto eggs and prosciutto dish over English muffins  was excellent but I would have loved a little side of hollandaise.  The kitchen didn't have any. 8.  Bike rack please!  There's no place to lock bikes to in the front.

Looking back, I wish I had ordered at 4:00 because I didn't get my food for at least 45 minutes to an hour.\\n\\nI ordered some Orange Chicken, fried rice, and an egg roll. The egg roll was okay, it's really hard to make a deep-fried roll of lettuce taste bad. The real problem was the Orange Chicken and fried rice. The chicken was served as long \\\"\"strips\\\"\" that were dipped in some kind of hush puppy batter and was most likely baked. The orange sauce was bland and didn't taste very orange-y at all.\\n\\nThe fried rice came in a very small container and held the consistency of cookie dough. There was no evidence that the rice had really been fried and had no other ingredients in it other than rice and maybe some egg. My chopsticks remain upright when I stick them into the bowl. The consistency alone was enough to turn me off to this rice.

It was valentine's Day and they had obviously packed more tables into the main dining area to crank out more $$.  The result was table's placed in odd configurations and ours half blocked a doorway.  We also had to listen to everyone's conversation because they were way too close.  \\n\\nThe food was not exciting, but we were ordering off a limited holiday menu.

Super cool. My group of friends are in our early 20's and an attractive bunch and go to Mabel's quite a bit so we walk up only to have the doorman turn his back to us and avoid us for a while; keep in mind there is no line at all and considering the 45 yr olds and strippers had just left the building we figured they would want a group of young attractive people in Mabel's but guess not. The bouncer turned around and says \\\"\"Can I help you?\\\"\" like he is the bouncer of some exclusive club in NYC or LA but the big, bald, fat bouncer needs a reality check and should realize he works at a small place with a random location, with expensive drinks and isn't the only place available in Old Town. So he goes on to tell us you must be a \\\"\"MEMBER\\\"\" OR ON THE VIP LIST to get in...gag me. Really Mabel's? A member at Mabel's wow...you guys are feeling a bit cocky eh?! Kinda sad because I use to recommend Mabel's to a lot of people and said what a cool place it was...I will never recommend anyone to go to this place ever again. We are people that come to Mabel's a lot and you just lost a good amount of business. \\n\\nI've never been treated so rude before at a bar and truly hope someone from Mabel's reads this and changes their ways. Good luck!", "Horrible experience. Bridal make-up run-thru was not cleanly. Artist, Tracy, did the application in 15 mins looked noticeably  uneven.  They tried to reschedule the up-do run-thru for another day after having the appointment a month in advance. Unacceptable treatment with forced opinions onto the bride. Blatant attempt at promoting other services at the spa after it was made clear they weren't desired. \\nNail technician who did shellac pedicure was the only positive, she did a wonderful job.  We were forced to pay for the horrible make-up application which was a poor decision reflective of the management.", "This is the worst experience I had with a vet.\\n\\nI have been going there for over a year and today I learned I have to travel tomorrow because an emergency.  I went to the vet for a good health certificate and they were not willing to help me.  They said the doctor that last saw my puppy was off, and no other doctor can do it.  No one deserves that treatment, they only care about money and not about pets or customers, if if was possible I would rate minus ten!\\n\\nThank God, Tropicana Animal Hospital was willing to help me, they made the necessary exams to my puppy, even tough I have not been there in a long time.\\n\\nI'm really disappointed in this Hospital, please DO NOT TAKE YOUR PETS here.", "Came here for an impromptu toddler birthday gathering - nothing fancy.  We each brought food to share with the other families.  The park is huge but we stayed within the \\\"\"amusement park\\\"\" area for the kids.  Signs clearly posted that no outside food or beverage was allowed since they had their own snack bar in there....so we were like well crap, we have all this food that we brought and we didn't want to eat outside in the park since the kids were all enjoying the rides....so yes, we broke the rules and ate inside where we weren't supposed to, right in front of the employee door in and out of the snack bar. And you know what? None of them cared. \\n\\nThere were a handful of rides: Ferris wheel, ATV-like bikes that go in circles, the train that goes around the park and the carousel.  There were other rides that accepted coins - those typical ones you see outside of grocery stores.  For $9 you can get an unlimited wrist band and your child can ride unlimited.  Otherwise, they are a $1/ticket and the train itself is already $3.  We bought our son the $9 wrist band and he went on each ride at least 4 times so we got our monies worth.  Only thing was that they were probably high school kids that worked there under no supervision.  They were goofing off with each other most of the time, having water hose fights while cleaning the actual birthday party area.  The rides weren't always occupied by an employee - you'd have to stand in line and sometimes wave someone down to come over and let the kids in.  \\n\\nYou can also buy a box of old popcorn for 50 cents to feed the ducks.  I don't know how healthy that is for them.\\n\\nOther than that, I wasn't too impressed by this park.  The McCormick Ranch Stillman Railroad park is by far better and cleaner.", "I went here with 9 other people for Memorial Day weekend.  I've been to the NY one which I absolutely loved and was really excited to know that there's a Serendipity much closer to me now.  First thing I noticed was that they have a window by the side of the building from which you can order to go.  I found it really interesting and convenient that they did that.  Although there were long lines, they seemed to be moving rather quickly.\\n\\nI have to say though, I was really disappointed by my experience with the Vegas Serendipity.  Their service sucks.  When I went to get a table, they told me the wait would be about an hour.  That's understandable and fine.  After 50 minutes of waiting, my friend suggested that we check to see how far along we were.  We go up to the bitchy hostess and she informed us that they had called us.  But our beeper never rang!  And we were waiting right outside their door the whole time.  Another server then explained to us that some of their beepers were broken and said that they'd clear a table for us immediately.  Which was nice except the extra little comment she had to add which was \\\"\"You guys are lucky we'll clear a table for you now\\\"\".  My friend and I just looked at each other astonished.  WTF?!  The beeper issue is not our problem, it's the restaurant's.  They shouldn't be so cheap and use beepers that are broken.\\n\\nStill, we didn't let that damper our mood.  We went on our merry ways and ordered a load of food.  (Their menu, compared to the NY branch, is not as long and may differ a bit)  I shared an omelette with a friend and ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae for myself.  \\n\\nThe omelette was plain but decent.  Nothing worth talking about.  The sweet potatoe fries that came with it were really good but not so much after you take it home as leftovers.  When our waiter was taking down our orders, he had made it a point to ask me whether I had wanted my dessert after or with my entree to which I replied after since I didn't want to the ice cream to melt.  For some reason, my dessert was brought out with my entree.  When I told the guy that brought it out, he proceeded to give me attitude and told me \\\"\"Well it's already here.  If I were to bring it back, it'll take another 20 minutes.  But I mean... I could bring it back if you really want.\\\"\"  I told him it was ok and he just rushed off.  No apology, no empathy, nothing.  Whatever.  I had a great dessert piled with whip cream that I had asked to be left out.  Oh well.  What could I have done at that point?\\n\\nOverall, it wasn't worth it.  The food for the most part is mediocre (my friend told me the One-Eyed Jack was bad and that the bread was so hard it was inedible) and the prices are high.  If you want to go just to say you went, then go.  Otherwise, avoid it.  There are a bunch of great buffets (Wynn!) you can hit up in Vegas.", "The only way I would return to this pub is if I were drinking, only.  The only way I would order food here again was if it were 1:45am, I was drunk and the food was deep fried.\\nWe went here because of a Groupon I had purchased for beer samplers and apps.  We made the mistake of staying for dinner.  Our appetizer arrived with our dinner.  We ordered the \\\"\"favorite\\\"\" app which was chicken skewer something...basically dried out chicken breast on a stick.  Disgusting.  The meals were even worse, and I'm not a picky eater.  I could go on but I'll stop here.  Hopefully this is enough for you to NOT order food here.  Even the waitress agreed with me, she herself doesn't even eat the food.", "Meh. \\n\\nOverpriced, psuedo urban hoity toity experience. \\n\\nShould you come here at least once and try some house cocktails for $10 each? Sure, why not. \\n\\nBut is this a place to frequent? Not at all, well except phonys. Phonys will love this place. Holden, however would hate it.", "One price for the cool decor and good service.\\n\\nWe went here because we couldn't make up our minds about where to eat. We don't usually do buffets, but since we were staying at Caesar's, it was just easy to go here for lunch. There was no line, and the place looked nice. But, the food was horrible. \\n\\nThe run-down:\\nPasta station -- pastas were way overdone, sauces were equivalent to Chef Boyardee in taste. Bland, horrible.\\n\\nPrime Rib -- Fatty, lots of gristle. Au jus had no flavor. Mashed potatoes were mushy. Horrible.\\n\\nChinese -- Fried rice tasted days old, and kung pao chicken tasted like shit. Horrible.\\n\\nSides -- Steamed veggies were ok, but you can't go wrong with steaming any food. Grilled corn was rubbery, tasted like it had been sitting there for hours. Nasty, horrible.\\n\\nDessert -- Chocolate chip cookies were crunchy, not chewy. Tasted like they were out of a package. Single chocolate truffles tasted cheap and stale. Chocolate covered strawberries were a bit mushy and the green tops were wilted and brown.\\n\\nSave yourself the money, time, and taste buds. Go elsewhere.", "I realize they're in this business for the money but jeez being my first time here it would've been awesome had you told me to wait 5 minutes and I'd get my tacos for less than half the price.

It's unfortunate, because they're one of my favorite quick and easy dinners and I would have eaten here often if it had been even slightly palatable.\\n\\nI got a fried tofu and veggie rice bowl and just about everything except the teriyaki sauce was below par. The rice wasn't the yummy sticky rice- it was just bland and squishy. The breading around the tofu tasted like raw flour and the only \\\"\"veggie\\\"\" I got was broccoli (which was at least not over cooked)\\n\\nI only managed to force down half of it. \\n\\nMy friend who ordered a hibachi steak teryiaki bowl suffered from crippling stomach pains later in the night. Plus, he said the meat was chewy and low quality. \\n\\nI don't think I'm going back any time soon. The only thing that makes that a possibility is Jennifer's review that said their salads were amazing... If they make them without chicken I might be willing to give that a try.", "I wasn't that impressed.  But we might have just gone on a bad night.  The waiter told us that their computers were down so they were doing everything by hand.  So our waiter took our order (and didn't write anything down).

Not likely to go back.", "We used to eat here all the time.  We moved out of Vegas for 18 months and came back and they had changed owners.

The air at the Luxor is stale and smelt of a nauseating vanilla/coconut covering up the cigarette smoke covering the entire area around the casino, but all the casino hotels were like that. Nicer hotels like the Four Seasons without a casino was cleaner and quieter. My father and I sat at the Aurora Bar drinking alcoholic beverages for a while on our last day, and after a couple of minutes, I could feel a burning sensation in my nostrils from all the smokers cigarette fumes. The pool was only three and a half feet deep and cold too. We couldn't sit on a cabana unless we paid to rent it, which we didn't like, but at least they let us borrow free towels. The maid service was good, but on our second day, they didn't clean our room or change our towels and bedsheets until we asked the front desk to do so. My father did not understand or like the fact that there were hidden fees such as a resort fee. \\n\\nAll in all, I'd say it was definately a unique experience staying in a pyramid, but not worth going back to. If I could, I'd much rather stay at a nicer hotel like the Bellagio or the Four Seasons.", "I attended this church for several years.

There was a ton  of noise from these places as well as the highway running parallel to the hotel as well as adjoining rooms.\\n\\nManagement was the worst of all. Horrible at enforcing the rules so other guests can be very discourteous as well as riff raff running around outside peeking into locked vehicles almost as if they were trying to find a way to break in. Head manager is very hard to understand as he doesn't speak English clearly with no common sense on how to run a business.\\n\\nOverall, one of the poorest run hotels I have seen in a long time and for the money, many other choices in the area which provide way better service and accommodations. So overall, easy to make a better choice anywhere else. Beware.", "This place isn't all that great.  Went there on a Sunday night, got a table and have to say that our waitress was one of the worst that I have ever had.  She took about 30 minutes to get our bottle out to us and then took another 30 minutes to get my credit card back to me.  After that she didn't come to check on how we were doing or refill our drinks like they normally do.  The setup of this place is really nice but the overall vibe is kind of lame.

The food was perfectly good--except it was luke warm.  We thnk it was sitting up there.  The restaurant was not busy, and not even half full.  Yet the tables across from us were left dirty and unbussed the entire time of our visit.  Very unappealing.  Mostly the food delivery was slow, the male waiter was slow, the food was luke warm.  Scrambled eggs were way overcooked and crumbled into small pieces.  Brown all over as in extra well done.  We did not complain.  We just will not be coming back.

I wouldn't recommend this location, as the customer service is poor.", "Service was horrible and the server had zero personality. It took ten minutes to get two beers.

Ordered omelets - mine with bacon, spinach and cheddar (which is lame that it's the only cheese offered for an omelet). It couldn't have been drier or more tasteless. There might have been about 1/2 oz of cheese, maybe one entire piece of bacon chopped up and a few leaves of spinach. The only way I choked it down was with Tabasco and because I am pregnant and hungry! My BF got a ham/sausage/cheddar omelet which was slightly more tasty, but if you read the above, you know that's not saying much. Waste of money and calories.

(also, for this price, soup or salad should be included. not $2.00 more. The shrimp were overcooked and  I bit into one and had to spit it out into my napkin... something I NEVER EVER DO regardless of how something tastes.. It had a foul STRONG fishy taste that was just absolutely nauseating. I alerted the waitress to this and she seemed concerned but offered nothing in compensation. My family members ordered other non-impressive meals.. the vito's italian sausage sandwiches were also cold, and had      slimy boiled peppers in onions.  My dad's Chicken Picatta looked like it was made with frozen-in-a-bag chicken breasts from the grocery store.. again, absolutely insulting considering the menu price.

The gym is terrible the pool is ehh. Just not what I expected.

If this is the kind of representation you are proud to promote for your company, then congratulations.

How do you stay open when you don't cook food to the right temp, I'm pretty sure they are microwaving left-overs! Service was aweful, didn't refill our drinks at all while we were there for an hour, no knowledge of the menu!  Take it from someone who eats Lexington BBQ a few times a month....

The second time that I went there a few friends and I sat at a table by the bar and waited 15 minutes before finally my boyfriend got up and walked over to one of the waitresses and asked for some service. When she finally took our orders she seemed annoyed at us, like we were bothering her. I really hope that the staff starts giving better service or else this place will not do well. Also, the girls that work there look kind of trashy.. That makes women not want to go there. It's not hooters, so they shouldn't dress like they are working at hooters. \\n\\nOne more thing, the staff should not be flirting in front of the customers.

Was hoping to get pizza like back home and was disappointed to say the least. The wings were good. The pizza was very doughy, not thin, dough was definitely not handmade. It tasted pre-made. It was very salty, not enough cheese, too much spice in sauce, and even more dry seasonings sprinkled on top, which is totally not necessary.

We went into the bathrooms and there was nothing weird about it. So we decided to ask the librarian what made it weird and he did not know what we were talking about. He then told us that if you look into a little hole in the wall dividing the entryways into the men's and women's bathrooms, you can see light from the fiber optics installed in the library.

I was then sent a statement of deposit upon which I was told that the $375 of nonrefundable deposits I payed when I moved in were strictly \\\"\"apartment prepping\\\"\" and \\\"\"administrative\\\"\" fees and aren't deducted from the cleaning/painting fees used to prep the apartment for the next renter.  I told them that contradicts what they just told me because they said that the money was used to prep the apartment.  Anyways, I am stuck with an additional $600 to pay them because they turned what was a really enjoyable living situation into a complete nightmare.  I wouldn't recommend living in this place.  There are much nicer complexes and neighborhoods to live in, and you won't have to deal with an unethical staff who lacks any sort of customer service skills.", "Finished watching a ballet performance and thought this place looked like a good spot.  Well I was wrong. I got the sampler platter, everything was over cooked and had no taste. I would have to say that Applebee's sampler platter is way better then what I ate. The waiter made me feel rushed and when I asked him a question he just said look at the menu. (Okay but isn't it your job to know the menu.) The bathrooms had a weird smell and were dirty. On my way home I starting getting a stomach ache.  Please done waste your hard earned money and eat here.", "Can't believe this place is still in business.  We went to the Harkin's Theater for an evening movie and decided to have a later evening dinner after, reverse of our norm.   Upon leaving the theater we quickly realized that we would have to walk somewhere to eat dinner since the roads in the vicinity were in gridlock, the Peoria Stadium had just finished up their 4th of July festivities.  We were quite happy to see Johnny Fox's Public House on the end of the parking lot.  The outside of the building looked inviting so we decided to try it.  We were greeted by a very nice blonde hostess who quickly brought us to a cozy booth in the bar area.  As she sat us, she handed us 3 regular menus, and 3 \\\"\"late night\\\"\" menus (it was 10:05pm).  I excused myself and went to the restroom (which was far from clean).  On the back of the stall door and by the sinks I noticed posted signs that discussed their happy hour and times, 10pm being \\\"\"Reverse HH\\\"\".  Right after I sat back down at the table, the hostess began picking presentation signs up off of all the table.  I noticed it was the HH signs.  Hmmm.  About that time, the server came back to our table and said \\\"\"Sorry, the kitchen has taken down their line for the regular menu, we only have the late night menu\\\"\", and he removed the menus from our table.  I then asked about the HH.  He said that they didn't do HH on holidays (not stated on the flyers, table menu or even their website that I looked at later).  Since we needed time to look at the alternate menu, we asked for a few minutes to decide.  I looked around and other tables that were just being sat were still being given the standard menu, even though by this time it was well after 10.  We asked to speak to the manager.  A dark haired man in a cheesy royal blue jacket came to our table side.  When I told him our concerns and said we would not be ordering anything else and would like to pay our check (my husband had ordered a drink), he just said, \\\"\"I'm sorry you feel that way,  would you like me to take care of that for you\\\"\" (meaning our bill).  I figured he would at least give us HH price on the 1 beer, but no, instead he ran our credit card for the full amount and brought it back. I have to say, we go out to eat about 3-4 times a week and with all of the wonderful restaurants to choose from in the Phoenix are, we will not make the mistake of going to Johnny Fox's Public House ever again.", "I reserved a room, and when I called to cancel the 2 nights reservation because my car broke down, they didnt let me cancel. And charged me on my credit card with out my permision. And when I was on the phone telling  the MANAGER that i can go an cant pay, he said that they were going to charge me and he hung up on me. Very rude customer service! Not Recomended", "The new restaurant just opened recently. We were very disappointed. My breakfast included runny eggs (ordered over easy), cold toast, under cooked potatoes.... not very good.", "The positives?  The easy to look at hostesses/waitresses and lavish las vegas styling.  The negatives?

My partner in crime rode shotgun rather than attempt fitting anywhere else in the dirty sardine packed van. They drive you to their office. The whole way I am texting my b/f my last will and testament, just in case! You get there and are told you will weigh in yay! You get some all you can drink cheap champagne in those fancy plastic cups ;) as you painfully wait to watch a safety video that basically sells their DVD's. Then you wait to get on another van that takes you to the actual airport. They pair you with 4 other people or 2 couples however way you want to look at it but it is done by weight. The pilot had the tour down he was very knowledgeable about the strip etc. I suggest not using your flash if the pilot says \\\"\"ahhh Go ahead\\\"\" I was dissapointed in the $35 video they get you waving before flight then again after landing its not even real sound and the dvd itself is just another advertisement I will probably never share with family or friends.

Had a chicken caesar salad. The chicken was over-spiced (which isn't a totally bad thing) and it was overcooked and dry (which is a very bad thing).

The staff was nice, approached us several times to make sure we knew how to order and how the menu works. The food was expensive for what it was. I got a vegetable panini and it was OK.

My husband stopped to get soup for us today and I forgot to tell him, and when he came home he had a small chicken tortilla and it was only halfway full.  He got charged full price. This is a big problem with this establishment. It's not what I would consider cheap food and yet they skimp anywhere they can. Tomato basil with orzo means you get about five pieces of orzo with your soup. Very unhappy with today's order.", "Okay let me preface this review by saying that I am not a big Epicenter club person. I like to go on occasion however this was a horrible experience. I understand that places like this want to seem elite and bigger than they are but they treated us pretty poorly. We went for a friends birthday and when we got there the place was dead empty! I understand that they have all these spots for bottle service only but we were a rather large party and we were dressed to impress and ready to spend some money. We were asked to move three times before they basically shoved us to the bar and said that was the only place we could be. We watched a lot of other people (who were not paying for bottle service) allowed in the other areas that we were not. I had one friend alone who spent like $600 that night not to mention we were a group of 10 plus more who joined later. I was so annoyed at our initial treatment that I just couldn't enjoy myself there and I for sure will never be back. Places have policies in place for a reason I get that but if you see a large group there to spend money you would think that common sense would dictate that you cultivate that and make allowances so they will spend more money. Regardless of treatment the place isn't laid out well, and the DJ wasn't very good. I didn't have a drink so I can't comment on the cocktails although I hear the bartenders were good. They at least were friendly where no one else who worked there was.", "This is only for breakfast, since that's the only one I've had.\\n\\nHaving tried several breakfast buffets on the Strip, I have to say this isn't anything spectacular.

A few extra points for the biscuits and gravy, the gravy was quite good. Oh, and the breakfast burrito mix with tortillas was a nice option.\\n\\nIt seems like a large enough area but its the same stuff at all the stations, so what seemed like a large selection really isn't. The food was all good, but nothing special and I've paid less for better on the Strip. The service was on the lower end as well - I realize they aren't going to be tipped much and I'm sure they know that, but when their only job is to take your drink order I get really annoyed when the waitstaff doesn't even bother to check and see if you need your drinks refilled, as was the case here. Won't be coming back.", "Do not waste your money. Worst chimachanga ever. Carne asada very good the tortillas were a disaster. Soggy. Chips and salsa nothing special. Chips\\n old and stale.

She told us the history of Primanti Brothers and we thought it sounded great.  If this is traditional Pittsburgh food that has been around for close to 100 years than the food scene in Pittsburgh is sad.  The cheeseburger sandwich was a dried out, overcooked brown disc that looked like a frozen Salisbury steak patty without the gravy.  The bread was soft and immediately got soggy from the cole slaw.  The coleslaw was watery and bland; the fries were cold, undercooked, limp, soggy, and had no seasoning or flavor.  My teenage sons will eat absolutely anything and even they thought it was disgusting!  We were starving and short on time so we ate and left after clearing up the confusion over the bill.  They hand you a handwritten ticket with no prices or total on it and she tried to charge us $55 initially.  When my husband questioned the amount she fixed it to the correct $42.  Honest mistake or padding her tip in this 'cash only' establishment?  The area around The Strip where Primanti Bros. is located was dirty and depressing as well.  I can't imagine why anyone would go to Pittsburgh, or why anyone could find that nasty, bland food appealing.  The worst food experience of our lives.

I learned that even though the ingredients are the same, whoever makes it makes a difference. I was so disappointed in the food!!! I ordered pork tofu soup and pork bulgogi. The pork bulgogi was too salty and the tofu soup tasted like ramen soup with a whole lot of water in it and the color of the soup was dark brown... Usually it's dark red. We told the server that it taste too watery. So he took it to the kitchen and came back out with the soup. I tried it again and it tasted the same but more spicy.. Like spicy water! I didn't bother asking again. I usually finish the soup but I couldn't finish this time. Decided not to go from now on...

Starting at the door where hasty greetings lead us to the back room it would be less that thirty seconds after seating that the blitzkrieg began - baskets and steamers that had clearly been propped against the wall shoved in our faces with several selections requiring an unannounced trip to the kitchen microwave - and kicking off with a trio of steamed options it was only BBQ Pork buns that proved competent as rubbery XLB and Shu Mai skins undermined otherwise juicy contents.  Still frenetic in pace as a $16 lobster special with slippery noodles swimming in ginger found its way to the table alongside a trio of excellent baked pastries it would unfortunately not be long before these gems were lost amidst overly salted garlic smelt and a dry coconut sponge, the duo immediately leaving me parched  as beverage refills lagged.  Admittedly underwhelmed at this point but willing to go one more round it was at long last (actually only 40 minutes) that Cathay House would rally with a strong finish from a duo of kitchen fresh carts - the crispy duck, sticky pork ribs, and supple shrimp balls all piping hot and reference standard leaving me to wonder what could have been had everything else been delivered fresh.", "We waited at least 20 minutes to get our drinks and over an hour to get our food.

I knew what I wanted and I told him before he started. I always get a full color shellac color and that time I wanted a full white nail with glitter on top. When It was finally time to put the color on he grabbed some polish that didn't look like the shellac gel polish. I asked him if that was shellac gel and he said yes. Then before he put on the polish 2 ladies started talking to him in their language and they both started looking at me very ugly and would talk to him. I got even more uncomfortable and bothered so I asked the ladies what the problem was. One lady answered me really rudely and told me that the white polish would crack if they put it on. I didn't understand how it would crack if \\\"\"shellac gel polish\\\"\" isn't supposed to crack. I told her that was fine but the guy doing my nails didn't say that to me and again she answered me rudely and said \\\"\"well he didn't know.\\\"\" OK that's fine that he doesn't know (since he seemed new anyway) but I really don't get what the point of being mean and rude to me was if obviously i didn't know that the white shellac nail polish was supposed to crack.

I ordered the vegetarian taco salad and it was atrocious.  It was a taco bowl that was over cooked and shredded ice berg lettuce, a few shreds of cheese (not even an ounce) and 2 red peppers that were the size of my pinky fingernail.  It was a joke. The service was sub-par at best.  The music is so loud you can't talk to someone sitting next to you and trying to order was challenging at best.  The server can't hear your order and you have to shout at them.  I guess that's why the server never came back to check on us or ask us if we needed anything.

She stated that she would provide our office with a new menu and then went on to tell me that the order would be delivered in an hour, which was perfect since our lunch break would be at that exact time of delivery.

She then huffed and stated she would look to see when our order was placed to make sure it had actually been an hour. After verifying that , yes, it had indeed been OVER an hour she began to check on the order status and explained that it may be about 7 minutes more before we would receive our order. \\n\\nI spoke with my co-worker who agreed with me that this was way more trouble than it was worth, not to mention by the time our food would arrive (given it would arrive in \\\"\"7 minutes\\\"\") we would then only be left with 10 minutes to eat.

I began to explain the situation with the menu pricing, he interrupted me and stated he would give me 5 dollars off my order. I explained to him that at this point we would just like to cancel our order and i did not feel that $5 would justify such bad service.

Opening the door, we heard Top 50 music, hood vents with a slight hint of \\\"\"Welcome to Mix N Mac\\\"\" Looking to the right of the register, there are examples of each size affixed to the wall. This made it much easier to decide on which size to get. \\n\\nTheir 'behind the counter' area was rather small, but clean. Two chaffing dishes with Mac n Cheese were next to their mix in station. We ordered our food and were given our cups. I wanted to avoid soda for once and opted for sweet tea (don't judge me!), which brings me to a question.\\n\\nWHY is it that restaurants have flavored tea and don't bother to a) warn their customers that it's flavored tea; b) not know what flavor the flavored tea is. The flavored tea that came out of their pitcher had a very funny taste to it, almost like the yellow Robitussin I used to drink as a kid, but thinner and with ice. The two employees had no clue what flavor today's tea was, but pointed out there was more sugar available if it was needed. Dumping the tea out, I went back to the standard Dr Pepper and crunchy ice.\\n\\nI was unsure how a Mac & Cheese place would handle the dish as a 'fast food' type establishment, or like a sit down restaurant. Turns out, more like a pre-made, fast food establishment. Two large chaffing dishes kept some macaroni with a cheese mixture warmed, awaiting a spoon to transfer it into the customer's container before the mix ins are added and put in the oven to melt the top cheese and heat up the entire dish.\\n\\nWe received our food and gave it a moment to cool down, the cheese was nice and melted, however, as certain cheeses are known to, the cheese formed a solid brick of cheese mix over the noodles. Cutting through it with a fork was not ideal.\\n\\nThe top cheese was a bit bland for me, the inner cheese tasted good.\\n\\nNot sure that nearly $20 for two bowls of Mac & Cheese + 2 drinks is worth it though. May go back again once they have been open for a while, to see if they improve at all, may not though.", "Came here on a sunday afternoon.Only 3-4 people in there. \\n\\nGot the gyro plate and was not impressed. It just wasn't very appetizing.\\n\\nIf you want something to fill your stomach when you are drunk, this might do it as there was a good amount of food on my plate.", "I moved to Pittsburgh from the Southwest and have not yet found any decent Mexican food. While I was wary of Mad Mex due to reading reviews, some coworkers insisted that I try it anyway and spoke highly of it, so I did. We ordered nachos and a carnitas burrito. The nachos were just not made well, structurally speaking. They were big and had lots of toppings, but the cheese wasn't distributed evenly at all, and wasn't a nice melty cheese sauce. It was also overcooked so it was just kind of like dried cheese on some chips with lots of cheese-less chips. The other toppings were okay but nothing amazing. The burrito was really sad. It looked like a square on the plate, not like any burrito I've ever seen before. The filling was almost entirely rice, which was okay tasting by itself, but there was way too much in the burrito. The carnitas were extremely salty to the point that I didn't even finish the meat. There were a few trace amounts of green in the bottom of the tortilla (I guess that was the advertised \\\"\"green chile\\\"\"), but they had almost no flavor or spice so it was hard to distinguish them. On the side was a flavorless pico de gallo and slaw, and some cornbread that was really mushy in the middle (undercooked). Overall, not impressed and not going back unless it's just for drinks.", "If I could give it less I would....This place is terrible.  My husband has only seen his doctor twice in the 12 years we have been here, the billing dept is a joke (good luck trying to get a hold of someone to speak with),  They have had their chance and now we are outta here.  Look elsewhere if you want good care with good staff.  There has to be better providers that this place.", "Tasty food.  Unbelievably poor service. \\n\\nWe had been personally invited to dine here by the owner and were so hopeful that we had found our new Thai fusion spot. Since we had friends in from out of town, we thought this would be a good time to take him up on the offer.  To  be fair, this place is really new and it was deep into service on a Saturday night, but nonetheless, Chao surely has some big hiccups to work out.  \\n\\nThe BAD:  We were seated for our reservation promptly, but not greeted by our server for about ten minutes.  Once he did arrive, instead of taking our drink order and apologizing for the delay, he told us to hold on a few more minutes.  He stated that the kitchen was really backed up and that we could expect a long wait for our food. \\nO.K., we thought.  As long as we can order some quick appetizers and drinks, we'd be happy to \\\"\"dine.\\\"\" When he finally returned to take our drink order, we slipped in an order for fried calamari and stuffed chicken wings (we chose them because fried = fast, right?)  Apparently not... not only did the drinks not arrive for about another ten minutes, but we didn't get the apps for another :25. When he dropped the drinks off, we knew we'd better get him to fire our entrees (even before we received our apps). Judging by the tables around us that (too) were getting annoyed, we were not alone in our plight.  Tables went unbussed, drinks went unfilled and people were generally getting pretty surly.  We finally received our entrees about 1:45 minutes into our experience, which leads me to...\\n\\nThe GOOD: Chao's food is really delicious. Aside from our appetizers being tepid when they arrived (I  put that on the wait staff), our food was delicious.  We had an order of Penang shrimp and two others I don't recall by name, but all were tasty and well presented. \\n\\nThe REMEDY:  When finally checked on by our server,  we mentioned the length of time we had languished at out table.  The remedy was that our appetizers were comped.  This was fine and surely appreciated, but it would have made our experience less anxiety-ridden had we been \\\"\"touched\\\"\" by the management or told earlier in the meal that something was being done to accommodate us   (we certainly were not looking for compensation).  I guess that is just part of the growing pains of opening a new shop.\\n\\nWell, I've certainly prattled on long enough, but suffice to say, we'll probably wait a few weeks/months before giving this spot another chance. I hope they are able to fix the kinks, because the food is (almost) worth the wait.", "Very slow service. had three people  bring the food, but it the follow up or service after that. No drink refills, waited 10.minute between boxing leftovers a d getting the check.", "Let me preface this review by noting that I absolutely adore Carl's Jr! They make the best chain burger in the country and the lack of Carl's Jr in my current city of Cleveland,OH is enough to send a man into a deep depression. \\n\\nHowever, since this review is for this specific location, I have to overlook my fondness for CJ to say that this is perhaps one of the most poorly run fast food restaurants I have ever been to. I used to work near this location so this is coming from regular visits to this specific store. \\n\\nThe staff are unfriendly (bordering on rude) and the service is slower than molasses in January. More often than not they get the order wrong as well. \\n\\nSo, as much as I love CJ, a short trip to a different location is well worth the drive.", "My main issue with this place is the way the football games are set up to be played on the tv screens. A group of friends and I decided to watch a 1:30 game here. There were no spots available for a group of 10 on the first floor so we decided to try upstairs. When we sat down we asked the waitress which screen the game we wanted to watch was going to be playing on. She informed us that it would be one of the smaller screens in front of us. As soon as the game started someone changed the channel to a different game. We asked if it could be changed back to the channel it was on before, but the waitress said there was nothing she could do.  She was kind enough to bring out the manager for us to speak to. Now at this point it's a group of 10 of us plus a family of six in front of us that want to watch the same game. We pleaded our case to the manager, Matt, who was extremely rude and stand-offish. He ended up throwing his hands up in the air and walking away leaving us in mid sentence. Now up until this point, our experience there was average. The waitress was very attentive and friendly, but some of our food items came out cold. After speaking to Matt the manager we asked if there was anyone else we could speak to. A different manager came out and in a more polite manner told us the same thing. We asked if we could close out our tab and requested that he speak to Matt on his customer service skills and maybe look into a different system of how to organize the way that the games are displayed so that this type of incident doesn't happen again. I'm not the type of person to complain but when two separate tables, 16 people total, request to have one tv screen changed to the game they want to watch, it makes lots of business sense to grant those request. With the type of management and logic that this place is run with, I will not be a return customer and I will make sure my friends and family know what type of establishment this is. The only reason this place gets two stars and not one is because of our waitress.", "SUMMARY: I will not go to this place again. Irrespective of price, quality and taste, this place gets zero points for service.\\n\\nDETAILED:\\nMy kids are enthusiastic about ordering from this place after we moved to its Glibert neighborhood only two weeks ago. I ordered 3 pizzas over the phone and was told to pick up after 15 minutes. I went there after 25 minutes. My pizzas were waiting for pickup. I pay at the cashier & collected my receipt. The girl at the cashier desk, after my payment, quietly proceeds with the next customer in the queue. No word about my pizza. I patiently waited until the cashier collects money from the next customer and delivers her her boxed pizza & quietly ignores me. Then she proceeds with the 2nd customer after me. At this point, I was not clear on what is going on. I politely asked the girl about my order. She replied that she has to take the order from the next customers. At this point, I felt frustrated and began getting assertive. The girl continued to ignore me. I had to use some loud complaining demanded attention of a supervisor or a manger. She said there is \\\"\"no manager on floor\\\"\". After raising my voice further and yelling for attention, the pizzas were handed to me by another store personnel.", "This place sucks!! I am from Chicago just recently sentenced to the valley, but I will tell you what, the food at this place is as authentic as a three dollar bill!!

The technician just happened to have the correct replacement on the truck, installed it, and ac unit worked. $400. So I use ac all summer. Next summer rolls around, and the motor is wobbling and sometimes wont run. I decide I will replace the motor myself, and I found a do it youreself supplier here in vegas called appliance parts center. The parts guys had to call the mfr, and get the exact correct part. The bad part was apparently the incorrect rpm rating, causing it to fail so soon. I learned that commercial cooling and heating had installed the wrong motor. They also should have replaced the fan blade, but did not. I learned a new condenser motor should last at least 5 years, and usualy when replaced, the fan blade should be replaced as well, to ensure a warped fan blade does not cause premature motor failure. I also learned that they had over charged me for the motor. I got the correct new motor and fan blade for a total of $230, and installed it myself. The motor was $150. commercial cooling and heating is a complete price gouging rip off operation. On top of that they dont even install the correct parts and do not care. I did a bit of research and the nevada state contractors board shows they have a history of not paying their suppliers, and home owners getting liems put on their homes.\\n Might want to avoid these clowns.", "Unbelievable. You try so hard to find an HONEST mechanic but in this town they don't seem to exist.

Sure enough, we took it to another mechanic, told him how these people tried to screw us, and they happily gave us a new battery, now the car is fine.

However, if you go to the register and get the grumpy African American female clerk on the far end (I see her almost every day I come in), she mumbles when she talks to customers and I find this rude. I always say thank you with a smile and she barely looks up at me. I continue to smile and say hello to her everytime, but she just seems miserable.

You can't please everyone.", "I decided to have lunch there this week with my son.  This restaurant is by far one of the worst eateries that I have gone to.  \\n\\nIt was the first time for either of us.  The hostess sat us down without a word.  We had no idea why she had not given us a menu and waited 20 minutes before I asked a passing waitress if we could have a menu, only to be told rudely that they were already on the table.  You see, the 'menu' is in a form of a newspaper that was folded in two and tucked under the ketchup bottle. We had noticed the 'newspaper' but though it was just that, a newspaper.  The hostess never explained this to us.  \\n\\nAllow me to add that we arrived after the lunch rush time. We waited another 20 minuted before our waitress came to see us.  I had no idea she was in fact going to be our waitress before she presented herself to us.  You see, our waitress had been 'cruising' the gentleman who was alone at the table next to us.  They ultimately exchanged phone numbers. She was more preoccupied with flirting with him than she was with doing her job.\\n\\nIt wasn't difficult to notice how scantily clad the women employees in this place dress.  I have nothing against sexy attired women, but this was ridiculous.  Three of the four waitresses had tops that were so low cut that I felt very uncomfortable. What is up with that concept ? Looking around I noticed that there were more male patrons than women, and I guess that I shouldn't of been surprised.  My adult son obviously didn't mind their dress code, but then again, he is a man. \\n\\nI doubt I will ever go back there again.  The food was quite bland and the decor left a bad taste in my mouth.  My son's nachos were burnt (black) and when we pointed this out to our waitress, she told us that nachos were supposed to be burnt.  Wow ! Really !?  This is not the first time we order nachos in a restaurant. In any case, this place should focus more on food quality than on attracting clients with eye candy. \\n\\nIf any of you have seen the movie 'forty year old virgin', than you probably remember that scene where the main actor is on a speed date and he constanly tries to close his own shirt as a reaction due to the woman in front of him having a wardrobe malfunction.

We had been in Vegas for a week for a conference, and literally hadn't left Caesar's in 5 days. Finally, the conference was over and we were free to leave the building. We went to Bouchon to celebrate and just have some fun! We were ready to eat, drink and spend some cash on dinner.  \\n\\nWe got to Bouchon where we were off to a good start with one of the best dirty grey goose martinis I've had. We were seated at a large plushy booth, and opened the cute little paper napkin wrap/menu. Everything on the menu sounded so good!  \\n\\nAnd the downward spiral of our meal began with our waiter... First, our waiter, I really don't know what to say. He didn't know the specials, he was just not with it all. He took away mine and my friend's empty wine glasses w/o offering another glass of wine. 3 out of 4 of us ordered the apricot and arugula salad, which was actually nectarine and arugula salad and he didn't mention it when we ordered it. We finished our salads, and then we waited, and waited, some of us with only tap water now to entertain our palettes, and waited, and waited FOREVER! Seriously, during our wait we never saw the waiter (nice play on words there!). Then he shows up and says, \\\"\"sorry for the little wait. haha.\\\"\" And I'm like, \\\"\"We're really annoyed with the wait.\\\"\" And he pretty much just laughed again and walked away! Mo-Fo!  \\n\\nAt this point I just wanted to pay for what we had already eaten and leave.  But our food finally showed up.  It was OK.  I had the steamed mussels in white wine broth served with fries.  Some of the mussels were not open.  I always thought that was a sign of bad shellfish and you shouldn't serve it.  The broth was good when soaked up with the bread, but the fries were too salty. \\n\\nWe had said during the meal, \\\"\"The review will automatically get a one star rating if the dinner is so boring you fall asleep while still at the table.\\\"\" Well, we definitely almost lost one to dreamland at the table and the dinner did bore us all enough that it sapped our energy to anything with our one free night in Vegas.  \\n\\nWanted to love it here, but totally did not deliver.  Just left the restaurant feeling ripped off.", "I wanted to like this place. Who else is open with happy hour with sushi at 2am when I'm having horrible cravings? But the service was bad. The waiter seemed to be pissed off or something and pretty much took it out on us muttering under his breath and all. It ruined our happy vibes and made us feel awkward. Just a very disappointing first time experience and sadly my last visit.", "Ill start with why the food is a one star then explain why the service is as well. \\n\\nFirst off I judge a Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa. Your food and service can be sub par but if you have amazing chips and salsa I will love it!  Not sure if ours was an old batch, but half our chips were wet and oily and the salsa was just tomato sauce with some canned diced tomatoes. Nothing special or tasty. \\n\\nI ordered a margarita just the house on the rocks no salt. We were sitting at a cocktail table so I watched the bartender grab a pint glass dump some ice in it then reach for a blender pitcher full of old pre made margarita and pour it in my pint glass. The server brought it out to me I explained that I really wanted a fresh made margarita. After a little discussion I just said no thanks I don't want a margarita anymore ill stick with water.  We finally ordered and then our food arrived and I cut open my chicken chimichanga to find it was beef. And my husbands chile con carne was supposed to come with tortillas. When the waitress came by again I explained that my chimichanga  was wrong and told her I thought my husbands came with tortillas. No apology offered for the mistakes. She just said oh ya  I can get you a side of tortillas if you want, as if she was doing us a favor. When mine finally came out corrected (my husband was done with his food by this point) it was correct but not really good. The chimichanga wasn't crispy (it's fried so it should be crispy, it was pretty soggy) and the black beans were just okay nothing special or flavorful. \\n\\nService wise - terrible. Once I sent back the margarita the server was cold, inattentive and refused to speak to me only looking and speaking to my husband. The manager did come by to address \\\"\"my question about the margarita\\\"\" offering no apologies for their methods just saying that they go through 60 gallons per week of margaritas. So what?!? I want a fresh made margarita not some warm pitcher of old margarita that has been sitting out on the counter for who knows how long. (By the way shouldn't margarita mix be refrigerated?) also after both our orders had issues we never received an apology or a manager visit or a comp or discount. Not expected but still nothing done about the problems. \\n\\nAfter all that I have no reason to come back. My husband liked his chile con carne but that's honestly the only positive of the experience. \\n\\nI guess our search for passable Mexican food continues", "We have been to Fuego Bistro SEVERAL times, and it FAR outweighs the CityScape location.  Besides the fact that Bistro has better food options, CityScape clearly squeezed into someone else's old business space.  We had to sit down a dark hall, more or less on top of the people next to us, and 6 inches from the emergency exit.  The drink dispenser sits in the middle of the dining room, as if you are at Subway, and their wines are stacked up on a metal rack from Home Depot in the middle of the room also.  Our waitress couldn't keep any part of our order straight...thought all we were ordering was nachos when we told her we also wanted dinner, then seemed surprised that we were sharing them (they are an APPETIZER, hello?!).  Every time she brought food or drinks, she got them backwards, which, whatever, we can swap them, but it made the whole place feel sloppy.  Food was meh.  We will continue to go to Bistro for SURE...their employees may be quirkier, but at least they are good at their jobs and the food there is WAYYYY better!", "I don't know, but I remember Outback being better.  This place feels smaller than your usual Outback, which ended up on us waiting 25 minutes for a table on a Friday night.  It seems to me that Outback has began raising their prices, yet there really isn't anything unique on the menu.  Service was super slow the night we went because one of the cooks had called in sick.  Still, management did nothing to comp the clientele.

A gentleman who had also been waiting to see a doctor comes out of the back and announces there is no doctor there. Several of us still waiting went up to the receptionist and got it out of him that the doctor was on her way from Tempe. This is after I had waited an hour and a half. I was told it would be about another 45 mins until she arrived. Needless to say, most of the rest of us waiting formed an angry mob and stormed out of there.

Let me tell you that it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  The fish was horrible and the shrimp taste like it came straight from the freezer section of the local grocery store...actually that's giving them too much credit, because I've had frozen food from the market and it taste 110% better. Not only was the food inedible, but the entire restaurant had a strange smell...that should have been our first clue.  A couple of people in our group had the Gumbo and I wouldn't recommend that dish either.  My son had something as simple as a hamburger, and that was just barely edible. Everyone had stomach issues immediately after leaving the restaurant.  We are all from Los Angeles and have had our share of good fried fish all over LA, so we know good food.

Value and quality has certainly dropped since I began going to Mr Lucky's in '96 when the steak and shrimp special was $5.95 and you weren't required to purchase a beverage and included a salad. The lemonade back in those days used fresh squeezed lemons not the powdered/concentrated crap they use now.\\n\\nThese days, you can still find the off the menu steak and shrimp special (show your players card to get the deal), but for $7.77 minus the salad (really? how much money did you save by taking off the salad?!) and you are required to purchase a drink ($3 for a soda/tea/lemonade) so in reality, your special is not so special at $10.77. The steak, I believe has also shrunk in size since the special began. The two things that remain awesome is the grilled shrimp and the garlic mashed potatoes. \\n\\nService, even sitting at the counter is spotty at best. \\n\\nIf you happened to look at the menu for other food, it includes overpriced breakfasts and other items. \\n\\nI guess if you are starving at 3-4 am, drunk, and don't want to stumble anywhere else outside of the casino, this will fit the bill, but I won't be rushing back here anytime soon.

I mean, sure, it isn't located in Beverly Hills, but come on!  I actually love Target, usually, but this place is definitely an exception.  It is still a step above Walmart, but not much above... like a half-step.  If there's another Target close to where you live or work, then I suggest you go there.  Unless, of course, you like the ghetto--then feel free to come here because you'll love it.", "Totally bummed that when I ordered TOFU and VEGGIES it came out cooked in chicken broth.  I'm sure it is my fault and I should have specified that I was a vegetarian but I thought that was implied from the conversation I had with the waitress and by the order.  I don't know any meat eaters (though I am SURE they exist) that order tofu & veggies when they go out to dinner.  I sent my food back and left.  :(", "The Quad replaced the IP.  You can read my review of the Quad there.  When this was the IP, it sucked for every conceivable reason.  Pulling into this place by car was impossible because you had to compete with a busy drunk pedestrian crowd.  The casino was old and dingy.  Even the downtown casinos were better than this.  The restaurants were filthy.  The rooms were disgusting.  Good to see it was replaced.", "HORRIBLE service. There was only one waiter and he clearly could not manage more than 3 parties at once. He was unable to explain the size difference between an appetizer and entree (later I found out it was because the entrees were smaller portions). I was served a glass with lipstick on it, clearly indicating that my glass was not cleaned. The chips were ok. To top it off, the waiter automatically added the tip into the bill and I had to ask for a receipt where I could adjust the tip. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant due to poor service, price, portion size, and dishonest billing practices.", "Unfortunately, my friends and I weren't thrilled with our \\\"\"Serendipity\\\"\" experience. A few of my friends spoke quite positively about the NY Serendipity location, so we thought we would give this one (located across from Caesars) a shot. \\n\\nWe first went to their outside service window, to purchase a sundae and a few margaritas. The person at the outside window was able to sell us a sundae, but we were informed we had to go inside to get our drinks. This made sense to me and was really no big deal at all. \\n\\nHowever, once I went inside, the bartender oddly pretended that the 2 for one (Margarita) coupon I had, wasn't good for this location. Since I had just picked them up from a girl (hired by serendipity to bring in customers) right in front of this location, that didn't make much sense to me. After I pushed the issue, he accepted them. I'm usually pretty easy going, but that just didn't sit well with me. \\n\\nAll in all, this location was sub-par and overpriced. The Margaritas were decent, but the ice-cream sundae was average, and the service was deceitful and poor.", "Her cakes are ok, but her lack of customer service is not. She's very snappy and can be rude. I would not recommend her to anyone. We had her do our wedding cake and an anniversary cake 1 year later.", "Very outdated, and super crowded. It is nearly impossible to walk in a straight line, and there is not nearly enough seating in the concourse.\\n\\nBoarding was very chaotic, as there was really no where to stand or line up without getting in everyone else's  way.", "Have given this place NUMEROUS chances cause they are around the corner from me. I want to love them but their food is BLAND (and that's being nice) got chicken wings that taste like rubber (how do you screw up wings?) calamari was bland, no flavor at all. So for me... overpriced bad bar food.", "Oy vey! This Peter Piper has been the worst I have been to. We had to wait 15 minutes standing in the front waiting for someone to take our order and there was no one in front of us. I am not sure if they were understaffed or just didn't know what was going on, a gentleman finally came up front and took our order as if we just got there. After ordering our pizza I went and played games with my son and half of the games were broken. After 30 minutes of playing the games we could get to work, I went and asked about our order (because there were only about 4 families in the whole place) and it was taking quite some time to get our pizza. When I asked the guy about our order he said it would be right up, 15 minutes later our pizza was finally ready. When I picked it up, they forgot we ordered wings with our pizza, so we had to wait for our wings to be made. The pizza was really dry and burnt tasting, the crust tasted like cardboard and the wings were tasteless, there was no buffalo sauce taste to them at all.\\n\\nDont think ill be making a trip here again", "I'm giving this review 2 stars only because the food wasn't so bad but I had dinner there today with my family (party of six) and the hostess, I believe her name was Gia was extremely rude to me and my father, she had a really nasty attitude. Our server Anthony wasn't bad except for the fact that he threw all 6 drink coasters from one side of the table as if he was dealing cards. I mean, I've been in the restaurant marketing business for over 10 years and have done business with over 50 restaurants and I've never seen such thing. Even if he was trying to be cool, that's definitely not the kind of service I expect from my server. I also overheard the table next to us complain about their server. Looks like they need to train their employees in order to provide better service. I'd like to go back there in the near future so I can write a better review but if I have to deal with this kind of service again, I'm done with this restaurant!  Thank you", "Started strong but the lackluster service.  With all the options Vegas has to offer, move on unless you're really tired and hungry (as I was).\\n\\nGarlic rolls were good but oily and cold.\\n\\nLinguine in white clam sauce was average.  \\n\\nStarted this review months ago and didn't realize I haddn't finished it.

My car went in completely filthy and came out virtually spotless and shiny.  I was impressed.\\n\\nSo, why only one star?\\n\\nThey stole all of my change that was in the cup holders.  Granted, there was only probably $5 total but still a very shitty thing to do.  \\n\\nNot coming back.  If you decide to go here, hide yo money.", "We were in town for the Cardinal football game.  We left the hotel and walked to district a couple hours before kick off.  We found most of the restaurants packed, with up to a 45 minute wait at saddle ranch.  \\n\\nWe took a gander at this place.  Checked yelp and saw only one review, it gave it one star.  With the main complaint being no draft beer.  Seemed a little strange, a bar without draft beer.  We went in anyway, were seated right away in the farthest corner of the place next to the kitchen door.\\n\\nLots of hustle and bustle about the place.  Cute waitresses, little shorts and cowboy boots.  Our waitress swings by among the traffic of other waitresses headed to the kitchen.  I order a Coors light in the bottle, while I study the menu.  It's a pretty standard BBQ joint menu, a burger with pulled pork on it catches my eye.  Looks interesting, so when the waitress returns with my beer I order it.  My friend orders the pulled pork sandwich.\\n\\nI grab my beer and take a big pull off the bottle and I am met with hot beer.  Not room temp beer like in England, but hot beer.  My companion tells me that the mountains are not blue.  I get up and find the waitress and tell her.  The waitress took the beer back to the bar then returns with the same beer and a glass of ice.  She told us that the bar tenders had got the beer on ice late so all of their beer was warm.  She recommended that I pour the beer over ice.  I had to tell her that beer isn't like a mixed drink, you don't pour it over ice.  I then ordered a coke as our food arrived. \\n\\nMy dinner looked appealing enough, a good sized burger with a heap of onion rings.  My companions sandwich looked fair to.  She tried to pick it up only to find the bun had soaked and fell apart.  I opened my burger with pulled pork to find, to no surprise no pulled pork.  We just decided that this was not going to get any better and ate some of the food.  The onion rings were good, the burger was at best ok, very dry.\\n\\nOur check comes and wouldn't you know it, that f___ing hot beer was still on there.  I just want out of this joint so I pay the waitress with two twenties on a 29 dollar bill.  Waitress brings me back a ten and one, one dollar bill.  No change to use as a tip, I left the one dollar bill as a tip.\\n\\nThis place is lacking in management and training for its employees.  If your running a bar and are only going to serve bottled beer put it in the walk in fridge a couple days before you put it on ice.  Poorly run restaurant, we won't be back.", "I've heard a lot of buzz around Pink's so when my girlfriends and I were in Vegas last month, we made sure to stop by. \\n\\nI ordered the bacon burrito dog which is a tortilla with hot dogs, bacon, chilli, and cheese. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything amazing either. I found it a little too oily for my liking (which i guess shouldn't be surprising given the ingredients) and a little overpriced for a hot dog. I can spend $8 elsewhere and get more value.", "I purchased two new tires from this location and the store manager, Shannon (male), recommended I purchase 4 new tires because all of them were \\\"\"equally\\\"\"warn out. The previous week, I had an oil change at goodyear and had my tires inspected and they recommended only changing the back tires. Additionally, i received a second opinion from the discount tire near metrocenter (where I purchased brand new tires in June 2014) and they said the same thing. So I took my car to discount tire on 15th ave and bell because they were the only ones that had the type of tires I needed  (or else id of gone to metrocenter) and Shannon agressively pushed to have all 4 tires changed. When i said i wasnt interested in having all 4 replaced he looked rather vexed. After I went back in to pick up my car keys after the rear tires were installed, i approached Shannon cashier station and i ask for my keys and he literally just walked right past me and didnt even acknowledge I was there. I stood there patiently waiting and after 10 mins of just standing there like an idiot someone else brought over my keys. I didnt like the low level of service at this location and Shannon should brush up on his customer service skills which is sad to say because he's the store manager. From now on, Ill stick to the metrocenter location. At least there they acknowledge your existence.", "Ok, to start I and my family have been to this one many other times and no complaints until tonight, 9-14-13.  We will never go there again!!!!    We ordered and both my mother-in-law and I had sandwiches.  She had the potato soup, I ordered sweet tea to drink.  Well it took a long time for the food to come and when it did another server brought the main dishes and  she noticed that the soup was not at the table.  So she came right back with a Cold cup of potato soup. I also asked for more tea and some ketchup.  Well the original server came and I had to tell her about the cold soup, ketchup and tea.  Scalding hot soup came. She left and a little later with, as it turns out, the wrong tea and no ketchup.  Left again and game back with ketchup.  \\nThe tea?  Well I was not willing to wait for a long time and just put some Splenda in it.  We finished and left to pay.  The cashier was very cheerful and asked how the meal was and I answered \\\"\"eehh, it was ok\\\"\" with a low obvious not happy tone.

I heard somewhere that because of the liquor licenses that \\\"\"all nude\\\"\" establishments can't serve booze. But some of the girls make up for that. \\nOverall I was unimpressed. Bigger isn't always better. There was a place on Freemont St. that was smaller, older and FAR better. \\n\\n\\nThe secret to getting around paying a cover is to go to your hotel concierge, ask about getting a freebee into a club. The limo driver gets kickbacks and can get you into these clubs for free. \\n\\nMy recommendation,  pass on this place.", "When I walked into the hotel and they couldn't find my reservation I should have taken that as a sign to find another hotel, however given I am traveling across country with two cats and the Crestwood is \\\"\"pet friendly\\\"\" and it's a holiday weekend in Las Vegas then I decided to stick with my reservation.  That was a big mistake...\\n\\nOn the plus side and the reason for one star vice zero (besides the fact you can't actually give zero stars):  The front desk staff was very friendly as were the maintenance staff that had to be called once going into our room and finding out the toilet doesn't flush properly.  The toilet eventually flushes, though it needs some prodding and patience.  \\n\\nNow for the negative: The chain's flier says \\\"\"Always clean and friendly,\\\"\" but methinks not.  The hallways smell of old cigarettes, the toilet was dirty (perhaps because it doesn't flush properly) and the room actually has cockroaches.  I realize cockroaches are everywhere, but really?  They are charging me a $50 pet cleaning fee for one night.  I feel like they should pay me a fee to watch their cockroaches.  We did check for bedbugs and see no obvious signs.  Hopefully in the morning there will be no marks they are actually here given we've made it across country through multiple budget hotels without picking any up.\\n\\nYou do get what you pay for, so I made the mistake of paying for this roach infested motel.  Please don't make the same mistake.", "My band has played here a few times but never again. We are an all-female band and the sound guy sexually harassed us over the PA during our soundcheck. We asked him to adjust our levels, and instead, he told us he could perform a variety of sexual acts to \\\"\"make us wet.\\\"\" Super lewd and vulgar. Not cool and we will not be playing here EVER again. \\n\\nAlso, the cover charge doesn't go to the bands. This is one of the few venues I've played at that doesn't give the bands drink tickets or even water. They act like they're doing the bands a favor by allowing us to bring paying customers through their doors.", "I'm sorry, they don't even deserve one star. We used to come here often because the food was good and prices were 'OK'. A few months ago we had ordered some pad Thai and the sauce came out tasting like BBQ sauce. We asked for a new dish and they said NO THATS HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. Wow, they couldn't even offer anything else.\\n\\nThey charge over $12 for a main dinner entree which doesn't even amount to a lunch PORTION. They skimp you on everything. We went back last week and I ordered drunken noodles lunch special. They now charge $8.99 for it and its a BENTO BOX. I literally got 3 pieces of broken up noodles with 4 pieces of shrimp and a side of rice. Its not supposed to come with rice but they did it to make up for the noodles...so why even call it a noodle dish? It ended up being mostly veggies too. We send it back and they just took off the rice portion and added maybe a spoonful of noodles! It was a WTF moment.\\n\\nI highly suggest you stay away if you've had real Thai food and don't want to pay $12+ for a tiny dish! Their service and food has gone downhill. They are robbing customers for $$!", "Check your bill.  When I asked why I was overcharged, dude claimed that the prices on the menu were \\\"\"old prices\\\"\".", "One server.  Food was cold.  Screaming kid.  Bad news", "So I was super excited when a new middle eastern restaurant opened up within walking distance. Unfortunately, I'm left pretty disappointed.\\n\\nTo the staff's credit they were incredibly polite and the service was great. Unfortunately the food was simply bland, especially the hummus. I'm pretty sure they just ground up some chickpeas and called it a day.  Also the food took way longer than it should have.  The cook must be pretty new to this whole restaurant thing because they only cooked one meal at a time. I had to watch them cook and serve the 2 other people who arrived before me one by one in order.  Given that pretty much everything served here is either already prepared or grilled, they should be able to prepare multiple orders at once.\\n\\nI'll try them again in a couple months just to be fair, so I hope some garlic and spices finds it way in to their food.", "It hurts me to say this, fue to the fact that I love local businesses in my hood and I fully support them, but here is another restaurant that I wish would have been better...\\n\\nGood news...More restaurants opening in Downtown, more options especially late night options...\\n\\nBad news...More restaurants opening in Downtown wanting to make a quick buck but does not deliver on food and quality...\\n\\nI came here with a couple of friends really excited to try the only sushi restaurant in DT open for dinner.

From the neon lights under bar to the wood paneling to the tin like tables, chairs, and barstools...its been done 30 times over.  I wish it had more character, a little bit more distinctive.  We are in the art district.  I don't want to walk in a restaurant that looks similar to ones that are already open in the same area?  Okay enough with that, the artist in me is rambling again..sorry..back to the \\\"\"food\\\"\" review.\\n\\nFood:  The menu to me was a little confusing.  For being a Sushi joint, it had so many other things also, mostly stirfry items.  I decided to stick to what I came here to try, sushi.  I ordered squid salad to start.  I should not have ordered that to start.  The salad was so salty and it was drowning in dressing...bad start...I then ordered some sashimi including saba, sweet shrimp, and of course my favorite toro.  I was a little disappointed that they did not have uni..how can you not have uni! \\nSaba...not bad...\\nSweet Shrimp....foul tasting\\nToro.....couldn't even bite through it\\nA good sushi joint has to have fresh fish...good sushi needs to be executed by a sushi chef with good knife skills...simple as that..\\nWhen your fish is not that fresh and your sushi chef fish slicing techniques are not there, you have a losing combo.\\n\\nMy friend out of frustration had the head chef make us something...He brought out the geisha roll.\\nSpicy tuna is not my thing but out of courtesy, we did ask him to pick, I tried it..it was ok, again I am not too keen on chopped up tuna, which in this case tasted like it was food processed.  A little too mushy..\\n\\nDrinks:\\nBeers: Been done.  Infused vodkas: Been done Cocktails: Been done.\\n\\nGood Points:  Nice staff, cool Teapots, and clean restrooms\\n\\nAll in all, I guess I was hoping for a sushi joint that was more innovative and creative with equally good skills to execute.  Maybe I am too harsh.  Or maybe I am just saying it how it is...As I left the joint, I felt like I have been to a sushi restaurant like that so many times before...\\n\\nHopefully they will succeed with less critical customers unlike myself..best of luck!!", "After arriving here based on several Yelp reviews I thought I'd give this place a try w/my family.

There was only 2 other parties in there at the same time as us, yet somehow everything was still very slow.  Slow to get any service and even slower to get our food.

We decided to wait it out since we had no other plans anyways.  \\n\\nThe prices seem way to high, in my opinion, for a small busted looking place like this so I fully expected the food to be amazing.

The portion size of the pasta was small and nothing special - I make it better at home; However, the pizza WAS good and my boyfriend really enjoyed it a lot.  If he were rating the place, he'd probably give it another star based off the pizza alone (but he's not \\\"\"Yelp cool\\\"\" yet so oh well).  I think it also took about 10 minutes or so after we had already completed eating till we finally received our bill.

The catfish bites came out first. They were \\\"\"eh\\\"\" could have taken them or left them. Our soup was forgotten about. After we asked the bartender who did not take our order, we got the soup right away. The soup, now, was very good-it had plenty of lobster in it for the size of the cup and was very flavorful. The guys next to us at the bar ordered a large oyster platter which did look very good so I'd like to go back and try that. Now, our bill was $35. That was not the issue. The issue was that we asked to have it split in half and when we got our credit cards back each one had been run through for $26. Now $26+$26 is way more than $35.

I have a 2 year old that coming home one night said: \\\"\"Daddy, kababs please for yummy!\\\"\" So we decided to try it.\\n\\nHe had a few bites, and looked at me and said \\\"\"Other kababs\\\"\" referring to our other Persian resturant in town, and then asked for his milk. The rice wasnt bad. Nice and fluffy but instead of adding butter to the rice we got they simply provided us a packet of butter on top of the rice.\\n\\nFor the same price as a lunch at a full service restaurant,. you can get a full dinner but its a far cry from their Persian competitiion. Its basically a no frillls fast casual place. OK meal but not really one I am going to crave too often.", "Super disappointed tonight to not eat here.  Had reservations at 8:15 and they were backed up - told us it would be 15-20 minutes.  Checked back a couple of times and the hostess was a bit aloof.  I assume it was because there were numerous people waiting for their reservations.  Checked back at 8:45 to be told that best case was another 20 minutes....not sure the point in reservations if you don't get to keep them.  Sure the food is good but we left to find something else.", "Looks good from the outside, but inside...service...NOT GOOD!  The food was substandard, dry chicken and for the price, not worth it.  I took my brother to dinner after a movie to Romano's and I should have just hit the Fat Burger or Texas Roadhouse next door.  First, the server Kelsi, was new or maybe it just felt she was new.  My brother had ordered tea with his meal, we were sitting there drinking, when my nephew looked at my brother's glass and said, \\\"\"What is that?\\\"\"  We looked at the glass and noticed this GLOB of multicolored brown substance running down the inside of the glass from the lip of the glass to the bottom (the bottom looked like a big glob of white stuff).  We all stated, \\\"\"Gross\\\"\" at the same time.  The reason it took us a while to noticed it was due to the lighting in there, it's dark...now I know why...dishes are not so clean. \\n\\nWe brought it to the attention of another server, we had no idea where our server went.  He stated the same thing we did, \\\"\"Gross,\\\"\" and told us he was sorry. Our waitress came over and brought my brother another glass of tea, and said, \\\"\"Sorry.\\\"\"  She didn't tell us what was in the glass (again we couldn't see), I would have liked to know because I brother ACTUALLY drank out of the glass but low and behold, she never came back after dropping off the glass.  It's was like we did something wrong and we were being punished...seriously never saw her again, just dropped the check off.  We didn't get served water again, were not checked on, it was pretty sad. \\n\\nMy sister had a pasta dish,I think the Chicken Milano that she liked, but my chicken skewers had some dry chicken on it, my brother had the half chicken that was dry but still good he said.  Remember, we didn't get visited again until the check, our server didn't even serve our food, we had it come out in three different sessions.  It was ridiculous, dry food without water...BAH!\\n\\nAnyway, after all this, I paid the bill, and thought, nope...need to talk to the manager.  I did, young man, stated, \\\"\"Well, I wasn't told about this.\\\"\"  And that was it.  Nothing else, no, \\\"\"I'm sorry\\\"\" \\\"\"Yeah,she should have taken care of it and helped you out,\\\"\" \\\"\"Oh sorry, your waitress should not have abandoned you.\\\"\"  NOTHING at all.  As a matter of fact, I felt uncomfortable when he made his big grandiose six word statement to me, that I said, \\\"\"Well, I thought you should know,\\\"\" and walked away.  THEN, THEN...to add insult to injury, I wasn't paying attention to the bill, so focused on my brother's enjoyment, that I didn't see...THEY CHARGED US FOR THE TEA!  Seriously, who does that?!  \\n\\nYou take your chances here.  Make sure you check out your silverware, glass, etc., I might suggest you bring a flashlight since it appears intentional that they keep the lighting low.  Don't want you to see what you are actually getting I guess.\\n\\nFor the price, the quality of food, the quality of service...it's not worth it. Go to Olive Garden, spend less money, they cannot mess up the salad too bad.\\n\\nWait, sorry...forgot to say I went on their website because I was so upset...I got NO, NO response.  Pretty pathetic!", "My mom and sister drove here from L.A. to visit me and I decided to take them to Applebees to treat them with an evening appetizer. This was at around 9:30pm about three weeks or so ago. We parked, we entered, we stood there for two or three minutes, we didn't even get a second glance from an employee, we walked out, we drove away, and we went to Chili's. That Chili's experience was well worth the Applebees exit!! Delicious!\\n\\nI give Applebees one extra star because I ate at this particular Applebees twice before, and it was a decent experience.", "On a warm Friday night I found myself with a group of friends wading through the crowd on St. Denis, we worked up an appetite but everything around us was packed, to make matters worse, one of the guys was a vegetarian.  I fired up Yelp for assistance and eventually we decided on Tibetan.  \\n\\nChez Gatse sounded promising with a long history and a location just off the main strip. I called to see if we could get a table, turns out the place was dead, which was the first hint that something was amiss. The owner, who was very nice and who took my call, already had a table set for us in the rather large terrace out the back of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe food was a big let down.  The bulk of the menu could be found in any of your average Chinese restaurants in Montreal.  I had one of the more Tibetan dishes \\\"\"Lhasa Chicken\\\"\" which was a chicken leg and thigh batter fried and then drenched in a brown gravy.  It was edible, but I wasn't impressed.  \\n\\nI was expecting something different but instead I got mediocre Canadian Chinese food. Their one saving grace is they have a liquor license and a nice terrace.  Regardless I can't see myself going back, the food was forgettable.", "Note: My review is based on their pastries and desserts and chocolates.  I read a lot of good reviews on their crepes but my rating is not based on crepes, since I have not tried that.\\n\\nI am a big fan of sweets and desserts...but I find this place overrated.  The desserts are beautiful to look at but taste just ok.  $8 ea.  Pastries $5 ea.  Chocolate syrup in a bottle for $16 ea.  Chocolate spread and peanut butter spread $12 ea.  I didn't mind the prices if they were really good...but they were not that special.  Pretty disappointed.", "I just figured out how to add my follow up to this review that I wrote last July.   I contacted Texas Roadhouse the following day per the response that I got from them.  The lady on the phone was friendly enough and asked a few questions about my experience there to confirm what happened.  She mentioned she was surprised that the lady that was doing the seating didn't stop us to get a manager.  On a side note, I just had this happen to me again at a Denny's with the same reaction from the guy who seated us.  I don't think these guys take their job seriously.  Anyways, the lady I spoke to with Texas Roadhouse apologized and asked me for my address and said she contact the restaurant to follow up and send some gift cards.  I thanked her and we hung up.  Didn't hear back from her again or get anything.  I don't even know if they followed up with the restaurant.  \\n\\nAround August I sent a message to Diania, the Texas Roadhouse representative who wrote the response to my Yelp review:  \\\"\"Hi, I wrote the review on 7/18 for the Texas Roadhouse in Gilbert. I called the 800-TEX-ROAD number the next day and spoke with a lady who took my information down.  She seemed concerned that the girl that seated us did not attempt to stop us and get a manager when we informed her about our lack of service while leaving.  The lady on the phone asked for my number and address and said she'd send some gift cards to us. I thanked her for the gesture and felt it was a great effort by the company to apologize for the incident.  We haven't heard anything back since.  The gift cards are not that important to me, but integrity is and if there was really no intention of follow through, it should have never been mentioned. I hope the person who took my info actually spoke with that manager of the Gilbert location.  I suspect the manager may not have ever been made aware of the situation that day by the employee, which, if it were the case, would be a shame.  I do enjoy Texas Roadhouse restaurants very much, and have been a fan of the establishments since the late nineties, when I visited my first one in Colorado Springs. So I have no intention of boycotting the restaurants, but I'm sure I'll avoid the Gilbert location.  Sincerely, Tom H\\\"\"\\n\\nShe gave a great response:  \\\"\"Tom, I apologize for the delay in responding to your email.  I have been out of town but will look into this immediately.  Follow through on any promise made by Texas Roadhouse is mandatory and not an option.  We pride ourselves on our integrity and always doing right by our guests.  Thank you for bringing this to my attention and for giving me the opportunity to ensure we do the right thing.\\n\\nDiania C\\\"\"\\n\\n\\nAnd....never heard anything back again.....here we are in December.  Oh well, I still go to Texas Roadhouse, For the most part, it's almost always a pleasant experience and I've always got great food.  Just the one location in Gilbert left me with some bitterness.  I think the fact that my kids, wife and I were hungrier than usual, plus the fact that it wasn't busy there just added insult to injury.", "I entered Shabu Fondue this evening anticipating a fun and filling meal. While fondue is always fun, I found this particular meal was lacking in the filling department. My husband and I ordered the cheese course for two (swiss and emmenthal cheeses with white wine and lemon), which was really delicious with apple slices and bread chunks. We followed up with steak and chicken (served with a selection of vegs and a hot, seasoned chicken broth). In retrospect, we should have given this course a miss and ordered more of the cheese! \\n\\nThe cheese course cost us $13.00 for two (portion size was very small), while the ribeye cost $15.95 and the chicken $14.95 (all prices exclusive of taxes). We both definitely felt that we would have been better off eating at The Melting Pot because, while it is more expensive, it offers better value -- bigger portions, a larger selection of meats and seafood, more choices in regards to cooking methods (oils and different kinds of broths), and fixed price menus for groups with 2+ people. \\n\\nThe atmosphere at Shabu was also lacking. A restaurant's quality can often be measured by how many covers it has in an evening. On the day after Christmas Day a restaurant should be buzzing. Shabu was nearly empty.\\n\\nI will say that our server was quite excellent, though. She was attentive and a great conversationalist. If the food we had consumed had been to the same standard, I would definitely have rated this restaurant with 5 stars.", "I recently visited Frank & Lupes in Old Town Scottsdale for a dinner with friends, and was very disappointed with the experience.  During the evening, our service was quite slow and erratic.  Our party was charged for small servings of chips and salsa, which they brought to our table before we ordered anything.  Some in our party were surprisingly charged for premium alcohol even though they ordered house/well quality.  Even worse, the salsa we were served was watery and of overall poor quality.  We had friends at another table, and they echoed the same sentiments.  \\n\\nI will not be returning to this restaurant ever again!!  All diners are forewarned!!", "For my daughter's Birthday she wanted to go shopping and get sushi. I'm not a huge sushi fan but I'm coming around. I do however love noodles! We decided to try Jade because of the review we've read.\\n\\nThe service was good but there was only 3 other tables in use at the time. Location is great. I guess we should have suspected something when we heard beach music coming out the sound system.\\n\\nThe table started with Edamame. It was fine. My daughter said the Miso soup was OK (she has had better). The Rainbow Roll was good by my standards but the others said it was just OK. The rolls did not stay together like they should have. A sign that they did not know how to roll sushi or just didn't care. Either way that should tell the owners they should take a long hard look at their staff. The Jonah Roll, I believe it was, was very good. The Udon Noodle was terrible! It tasted like dirty dish water that  someone put a lot of fish sauce in to hide the fact it was dish water! The Pad Thai had no flavor at all! \\n\\nI am usually not this harsh but on top of the food being less than mediocre, we were all sick the rest of the day! What a way to spend your Birthday! We will never go back there again!!", "Terrible customer service. Lied to several times about why it took 1 month to receive my dogs license after it was paid for.\\nWhen I was able to get ahold of someone they were rude.\\n\\nLOL, I guess working for a shelter gives you great power and authority to enable you to treat people badly.\\n\\nYou people are a joke.", "Due to the fact someone from this car was stole my Red Rocks annual pass from my glove box, I would tell everyone NOT to go here.  !!!

Don't bother arguing a wrong bill, they will never correct it, set your money on fire instead. For 165 bucks, you get 32 channels and slow, spotty internet \\\"\"service\\\"\". Can not wait for Google fiber. Get the internet and go with a Roku box or Apple TV, or, sign up for satellite. Or, if you are really set on Cox service, just go gamble your 200 bucks a month, give it to a homeless guy or blow it at the bars, you will have much more fun.", "I, like another reviewer, really wanted to like Big City Dogs.  The menu sounds great, but it pretty much stopped there.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good enough for me to say that I will give them another shot.  I'm thankful I had a Groupon!", "Short ethnic hair be warned!! Definitely not what I expected. Walked in and asked if they had the thin flat iron ( not a regular one ) since I have super short hair. They said they did...they didn't ( after my hair was washed) After they did my hair I noticed something was different but I was in such a rush. Once I looked in the mirror at home and compared pictures...I realized my hair was pulled so much with the brushes  my bangs are all split ends now and an inch shorter or more in some places. I can't even get my fingers through the top part of my hair anymore... Now I'm going to have to cut my hair down to a 2 inch length on top. Not a happy customer. Definitely would have expected the drybar to really take the time to look at a hair type and know what not to do. And if you can't do my hair... And it's breaking off ... Please tell me... I would rather know before my hair is done.", "Was among my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Came in from AZ to get my favorite food, looked forward to a chicken plate the whole drive, got in late, and arrived 10min before closing.

I'lll NEVER come back here.. you lost a very loyal customer due to a very lazy cook. I guess after expanding they forgot about the ones who matter.. the ones who provided the business and referrals that allowed the expansion. Crappy.", "This place is OVERRATED in my opinion. The best thing there was the $2.00 glass of Kool-aid. I expected the chicken to be amazing and it was just \\\"\"ok\\\"\". The waffle was horrible and cold once it made it to my table.\\n\\nThe worst part of my experience was the service. It completely sucked. I'm not sure if the assign a server to your table or not because they had different people \\\"\"helping\\\"\" us. At the end of the night I wasn't sure who I was tipping.\\n\\nWith the overrated food and the awful service, it only makes sense that it would be over priced as well.\\n\\nDon't fall for the hype.", "The folks behind the counter were pleasant, and the \\\"\"greek salad\\\"\" to go was arranged nicely. I say \\\"\"greek salad\\\"\" because it was basically a normal salad with olives, feta, and banana peppers. I see what you did there with those pizza toppings. \\n\\nI've had better frozen pizza, though we did grab whatever slices had been sitting under the heat lamp. Their soda machine was either out of syrup or not working that day, and we had to inform them about it since they weren't aware. They offered us a can instead, which was technically a downgrade from a ~16oz cup to 12 oz. \\n\\nI think this is more of a to-go place, since their phones were inexplicably ringing off the hook.", "I had a buy one get one free entree coupon which was the only reason why we went here.  Got the ribeye and she got the filet.  Both were fine but nothing compared to the best steakhouses in LV.  It was nice that the steaks came w/ a potato and salad.  Sides were below average.  The creamed spinach wasn't good and the sauteed mushrooms/onions was not worth $7. \\n\\nHad reasonably priced bottles of wine which were fine.  Bread served was the same as every other restaurant at Southpoint.\\n\\nI would definitely choose Outback over this place.  Not saying the steaks were bad..they were fine but just not worth going back for in a city with so many excellent places for steak.", "We went here for my birthday and we've been to just about every high-end steakhouse in town including Craft Steak over a dozen times and thought we would give Heritage a shot and it was horrible from the service on.  We shared a couple of apps--the grilled Romaine and onion soup, the romaine tasted sour, almost rotten, however the soup was good.  We got a few steaks and the brisket that were just ok considering the price. They gave us a \\\"\"free\\\"\" birthday dessert that was a the size of a mini muffin and wasn't really great.

This 2 star is truly only for the coconut curry. Really, really disappointing.", "The food can be good here but they are wildly inconsistent. I come here often because a friend of mine works here and the service from her is great but the rest of the service is far below avg. They have gotten my order wrong several times. The bar area is either way too cold or too hot. It is never a comfortable temperature so dress in layers. Lastly, the place is absolutely boring. They have tons of TVs but could use a Golden Tee or Touch Tunes in the bar area. They desperately need something to liven the place up.", "Popped here to this quaint little basement restaurant. Service was a bit of a miss - the waiter kinda felt like he was busying all over and not that attentive and really rushed our order, wanting to swipe the menus back off our hands. Foodwise, was so so, the BBQ beef was quite tasty, the other hot and spicy tofu soup was rather bland and an instant noodle could've been more flavoursome.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is reasonable with the aforementioned wood panels and it would be good to come with friends. Portions were kinda small too and the sides of kimchi etc were put out for all of us to share - we felt cheated out of more here.\\n\\nService charge of 15% was automatically added to the bill and appears to be calculated on the post tax amount. Not sure if this is right or custom but there we go. We won't be coming back here.", "I went with my family. They told us on the phone it would be $28 per person. We got there and it was buffet style, all u can eat salad, and various meats brought to your table and sliced onto your plate.  Appetizers were brought to our table also. The atmosphere and food is impressive and they've got 5 stars so far until I get the bill. They charged extra for desserts and drinks which it was assumed came with the buffet. $7 per dessert and about $3 per drink which made the bill about $30 more than expected. Those hidden costs were pretty underhanded because they even brought the dessert cart to the table and asked what we wanted for dessert. It would be just as unfair as finding out that the various poultry meats offered contained an extra charge.There were no menus and nobody told us drinks and desserts wouldn't be included in the buffet. I hope you scammers go out of business for pulling that crap.", "Must have come on a bad day. My wife got the grilled wedge salad. It was not grilled, they forgot the bacon and left the lettuce core on it.  Burgers were ok not great. A bit overcooked. 2.50 for onion ring upgrade and you get four rings. They really need to do something about the flies, there were thousands.  Lots of swatting going on. Saw a maggot on our table, not surprising.  At least we can say we tried it.

I then spent 8 hours on a gurney, waiting for a room becaue of a nurse shortage.  After two days I hadnot seen a cardiologist.  The second day, the cardiologist sent over his nurse practicioner.  Wow!  Could you spare her!  The third day, my heart beat had stabilized, but Ihad to wait 2 hours to be discharged  for the big cheese cardiologist himself, who had not bothered to drop in, to see me so I could leave.  He was a slick hustler with dyed hair who called me \\\"\"young lady\\\"\" (he is not a young man himself) and talked to me for two minutes.  Ugh.  Id never go to this hospital again.  A summary:  one of the nurses got into an argument with a heart patient , with her voice raised, over how long people\\nhave to wait in emergency rooms.  I froze all night, and am covered with bruises from their inept staff taking blood.  Dr. Noori, an internist, was a gentleman and a good doc--hope he finds work elsewhere.  The idea of a cardiologist being too busy to see a patient and sending a frickin nurse instead, still makes my blood boil--avoid this place unless you are half-dead.", "Everytime I go to this place I wonder why.  Why do I pay for the VIP wash when they do no more than what you get for the basic?  I went this last weekend and my SUV literally went from vacuum to wash to interior in less than 10 minutes. \\nYes, you'd think that would be a good thing.  But there were literally 3 cars ahead of mine in the row it was in.  This place is based on pushing cars through, NOT cleaning them.\\n\\nThey did nothing more than smear their cheap version of armor-all on the tires and wash the windows.  This is VIP?  What a joke.  I told the attendant (who actually spoke english!) to run it through again, this was pathetic, but he said, no I'll clean it, and he took a dirty rag out of the back of his shorts (he might as well have used his tighty-whities, they'd be cleaner) and started rubbing down the console and such.  \\n\\nYeah, that's what I want.  Danny, you should be ashamed to put your name on this joke of a car wash.  And I should be double ashamed to have run my car through this place repeatedly over the years.   What am I thinking?  I'm an idiot.  Never again.", "This review is for alterations only. Based on other reviews here, it seems they are good at dry cleaning, so I'm suggesting they just stick to that. I had a handful of garments altered here and they all turned out poorly.\\n\\nI needed some business casual clothing taken in and hemmed on short notice. That's what I got. I even got a discount for paying cash. Everything seemed great until I got home and tried on the garments. \\n\\nOn one pair of pants, the legs were hemmed at different lengths (one shorter than the other). On another pair, only the back seam was taken in (rather than the 2 sides), moving the back pockets ridiculously close together. A blouse was taken in too much near the top and not enough at the bottom, causing a lot of pulling across the bust and a weirdly loose fit elsewhere. \\n\\nBottom line: trust them to clean your clothes, but not to alter them.", "Very awkward and inconvenient lay out. The rooms are in multiple towers, and the parking is in a paid lot a block away that you have to present coupons to leave. Decor is shappy and very out-dated. Huge empty lobbys and hallways wasting space. The restaurant is only open after 5, as is the bar, and there are no places to eat in the near vicinity. The rooms are unattractive and small. My company is paying for this, but this place is massively overpriced, especially considering how many nicer and cheaper hotels are in the same area.", "I used to stay here when it was Wynn owned and operated and things have changed for the worse.

The appetizer we got was the veg pakoda - not very bad, but just ok - pretty bland though. The soup had nothing but ginger in it. We got 2 curries of our choice. Among us 3 we ordered bhindi masala, palak paneer, dal makhni, paneer tikka masala, kadai vegetable and mutter paneer. Other than the palak paneer, nothing was even remotely good. The plain naan was ok. The rice was old. The desert - gulab jamun - was burning hot but was not bad. Service was good, but they definitely need to get a good cook. One star is only for the service. Bottomline is food was very bad and I would never go there again.", "My boyfriend and I came here for a stay-cation for our anniversary from tucson, away from the kids for one night and let's just say that was long enough. \\nWhen we arrived the staff was okay, and we found our room easily. The room is very small and everything smells musty, I know it's an old place but the halls and rooms don't get any fresh air. My favorites about the room were the comfy bed, and the vanity area. \\nWe didn't eat dinner here because nothing looked appealing enough for what the prices were, so we just did happy hour with a pushy waitress, then went elsewhere to eat. \\nThe breakfast buffet was good though, only problem there was the waiters there were so rude, ours in particular was no help. He walked by and said \\\"\"let me know if you need anything\\\"\" and walked away. Didn't ask what we wanted to drink and didn't start with waters like we saw him do with other guests. By the time he came back with water and we had to ask for our drinks we were almost through with our food. So our good breakfast was short lived. \\nI don't know if it was because we are a younger couple mid 20's why we we're given this attitude and dirty looks by most of the staff, but definitely wasn't appreciated. It was a waste of money. \\nPools were nice but we didn't use them. \\nNeedless to say I won't be returning.", "I might give this place a 3 1/2 stars. This place opened up a week ago and i just had to try it because it is at monte carlo where i usually stay at.  Let me first off by saying the service itself was very good since one of the main guy Cory came to our table asking us how everything was and making sure we were happy. He even gave us a complimentary shashito pepper app which was very good..Thks Cory..ok now for the rest..\\n\\nWe ordered housemade pickles, pork shoulder bun, steak with nori, chicken wings, shrimp ramen, and mushroom ramen.. \\n\\nThe house made pickles were actually good..fresh and tangy and refreshing. But for $9 not worth it. One of the server also came and picked up the dish without asking us if we were done with the pickles and took it away when we had one pickle still left in the dish. for $9 im going to eat all the pickles but was unable to since the server took it off our table.\\n\\nThe chicken wings had a good taste to them and i enjoyed it for the most part.. I would like the chicken wings more well done and crispier than how it was served . but overall not bad. $9...same price as the pickles which makes no sense.\\n\\nThe pork shoulder bun was good..very good flavor..but the bun was cold. Im sure sitting outside played a role in the bun being cold . but i kinda expected a hot soft steaming bun. But maybe thats how its suppose to be served..not hot. The bun was $9..FOR ONE! cmon..i surely thought it was served with two..but they did warn us it was just one. \\n\\nSteak Nori was very very good..good flavors and the meat was tender and the nori was dry and crispy..how it should be..the mushrooms on top had a very nice flavor..but for $39 not worth it at all..\\n\\nThe shrimp ramen was good for the most part..the only thing was the broth..it tasted very shell fishy..the noodles were cooked good and the shrimp was awesome..but the broth taste was a little off. The ramen was served in a tiny bowl which seemed like a large drinking cup..$22 not worth it at all.\\n\\nThe mushroom ramen was good i enjoyed it..no complaints there at all..the mushrooms were good, the tofu had good flavor, nooodles were cooked al dente which i like. the broth had good flavor and i love soft boiled eggs and it had an egg in it which had a soft yoke. Again served in a tiny bowl ..not worth $17.\\n\\nFinally the shasito peppers..only complaint is ..wish it was cooked lil bit more..but thats just how I like them but this one was free so it was the best!!\\n\\nOk...overall not bad..flavors were there but the food could be better..Cory kept asking how we liked it..and we told him it was good..i really didnt complain to him because my MAIN problem was the price and portion size which he cant really do anything about. Would i go back to Yusho?....maybe if someone treated me..but i would not go there again with those prices..the prices were ridiculously high for the portion size and the quality. \\n\\nCory..lower the prices and give us bigger portions..then maybe il return..anyways thks for the experience:)\\n\\n\\nUpdate: 11-29-14 visit..\\n\\nI revisted this place because i was inthe mood for some ramen..I figured its been a while so they mustve improved in some of the negatives i mentioned  above. Well it didnt.. the portions r still small(ramen). The only thing they did was serve the ramen in a bigger bowl making it seem like the portions are bigger. I got the kimchi ramen and the broth was sooo plain..needed spices or seasoning or something. Anyways i wont be coming back to this place unless im forced to, too drunk and dont know any better, or because im starving and thats the only place open.", "Found this place via Living Social last year.  It was an Ok experience.  We went back recently and discovered it's closed now.  Too bad.  Cool concept.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 0%", "Avoid this restaurant!!!\\n\\nIn the biggest hotel in the world with 39 restaurants, this should be your last choice.\\nThe ambient is terrible: really bright lights, a high ceiling and a really open space reminds me of a mess hall from a outpost. The windows are really big and the restaurant partially open, which makes you feel like in a shop window and exposed. The noise from the Cassino mixes up with the noise from the kitchen.\\n\\nThe menu is out of laminated paper: compared to leather covers from the other 29 restaurants, it looks cheap.\\n\\nThe service is friendly but does not talk fluent English. The food gets thrown to your table in less than 5 min after ordering: it was pre-cooked!\\n\\nThe taste of the food is terrible. A lot of grease, duck with feathers yet and no spices at all on the food.

Mind you the tank top was brand new and he looked very nice in it. We arrived a good twenty minutes early and so headed to the bar for a couple Coronas. 2 beers - $11 plus tip. The restaurant is located in an industrial section of Vegas. You literally feel like you're heading to a storage warehouse somewhere. The first hostess was very nice ( Asian of some sort) , when we headed to the restaurant after the beers we encountered the hostess from hell (blonde white girl) who proceeded to read us the riot act about the dress code. I was so pissed off and obviously felt slandered by this gal that I told her we wouldn't be eating there. We proceeded to leave when she attempted to placate me by offering to get it ok'd by the manager.  REALLY , you must be kidding. Will never be back even if the food was free.

We were both so offended, I ordered something in haste and he refused to even order, though we were both STARVING. We were so upset that as soon as I got my food I asked for a to-go container. It wasn't that great, honestly. For the price the food is totally sub-par, and it's not even that expensive. Just not worth it. \\n\\nTerrible service, blah food. Pass on this one.

The hostess (because our waiter has disappeared into a space-time portal) says no because we are having lunch not in the bar.....uh....don't you think you or the she or the waiter could have mentioned that a) there is a happy hour for what we said we were interested in or b) everything we had was on the happy hour menu if we wanted to sit 20ft away at the bar with plenty of space?\\n\\nWe requested to shift to the bar and get 2 for 1 drinks and the same food for less.  This apparently got everyone's panties in a bunch.  The hostess kept having to \\\"\"ask the manager\\\"\" who for some reason refused to come over to the table.  The waiter popped back in from the portal to said that the food was made so it was not possible.  We eventually got up and addressed the manager ourselves because we watched him avoid dealing with the issue by personally by pouring water for other guests and bringing their food (isn't that the waiter's job?

My family and I went here this evening because we had been to the one in Phoenix and were pleased but I cannot stress enough the terrible experience we had.  The waitress forgot to put in an order and we were almost done before the meal came.  She never once came to explain or apologize and an apology would have gone a loooong way.  She basically ignored us from then on - put on your big girl panties and deal with it.  We asked for the manager who was either ignorant or arrogant but regardless his lack of managerial skills, social skills and communication skills simply made the entire situation worse. We explained we were there for a celebration and were told we would be given a dessert.  A different waiter attempted to put the dessert down on our dirty table because no one could be bothered to clear it...really????  So WE cleared our table , so that he could put it down and did we then get utensils to eat the dessert?  Nope.  The original waitress finally reappeared to see if everything was ok - seriously?  Were you on vacation the past hour?  And then on our bill we were charged for the long awaited meal and the dessert we were told was to be on the house.  Again, the manager with the seriously deficient intelligence ignored us - did he go to the same school of stupidity the wait staff attended?  And then he kept us waiting even longer for the new bill, which was a complete joke.  The food was average but I'm guessing the reason it was so completely dead in there on a Sat. night in Scottsdale is because the manager and staff are inept, rude and pathetically incompetent.  Oh, but thanks to the really brilliant waitress who gave the scotch to the 17 year old!  And the IQ points just kept continue to drop....", "We went here for New Years tonight and it was such a disappointment. When I called to make the reservation the woman on the phone actually asked me if my party could be done eating by 8 because they had another party. Still went, based on reviews and the menu we were pumped to try some place new. When we arrived we learned it was a select menu that only had 3 options for each section and they were not necessarily the best options, nothing to do with Italian food except one pasta dish. My pasta along with others rice pilaf was in need of seasoning and my pasta has lobster in it that you had a hard time tasting. Those in my party that had the lamb chop said it was great but very very rare. Atmosphere is nice and intimate. It was a shame, if they had their whole menu available we might have found a reason to come back, but everyone in my party agreed next time this place is a pass.", "Saw the wonderful Dolly Parton here last night.

We agreed to a side salad instead of the fries (obviously disappointed).  When our order came the Phatty philly was good but it had no blue cheese or mushrooms inside which are two main ingredients. The side salad had chopped cucumbers in it which my husband was very specific in ordering no cucumbers  in the salad. They remade us a salad no problem and the house dressing was very tasty but the tomatoes were soggy. Now when I bit into the Sirachi taco I was expecting the same goodness as the Ahi Tacos but was caught off guard with how disgusting it was. I literally wanted to spit it right out my mouth. It was as if they hadn't seared the fish at all. It was a cold fish taco. Yuk!! Even though we had a bad experience I will give this place one more shot because the first time the food was so good. Maybe then I can give it a better review.", "As a car-less denizen of PGH, I rely on PAT buses to get from Point A to Point B.  Living in Oakland, PAT offers buses to many places I need to go (downtown, the grocery store, the airport, etc.). As a PITT employee, the price (free) is right.\\n\\nHaving said this, I have several gripes:\\n\\n1.) Buses almost never run on time, and there's no way to know when the next one is coming other than asking the other people at the bus stop how long they've been waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device should be in every bus so you can check to see where it is, or there should be a SMS alert system.  Singapore had this for their buses in 2010!\\n\\n2.) Some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant. More than once, a bus has passed me when waiting at a stop for no apparent reason, or has failed to hold on for 5-10 s. as I huffed and puffed to catch it. For whatever reason, the outbound 28X seems to be especially problematic.  True story: Last time I rode it, the driver didn't know where she was going, and we ended up crossing the Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling her this wasn't the route. To make matters worse, this was the last 28X of the night, so due to this detour, I didn't get home until after 1am.\\n\\n3.) Regardless of which route you ride, the clientele can be a bit sketch. Some drivers will also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher out of pity. On one occasion, a pax regaled the bus with nonsensical poetry (not sure if he was under the influence or just mentally incapacitated...), and the driver did nada about it (though it was amusing).\\n\\n4.) The system of when to pay is nonsensical.  Despite having a terminal degree and having lived in PGH for 3 years, I still haven't figured it out, and have to rely on cues from the bus driver. While I understand the reason behind it (the free zone downtown), there must be a less confusing solution.  Get on it!\\n\\n5.) For those who don't have a PITT or CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For a round trip, when you pay for the first leg, ask for a transfer and use it on the second leg--this shaves $1.50 off your fare.\\n\\n6.) Even in Oakland, where route options are better than in most areas of the city, there are no direct buses to some areas I'd like to visit (e.g., the Strip). Also, other than the P1 from downtown, buses serving the East Busway only run during rush hour on weekdays, and even the P1 only runs hourly off rush hour.\\n\\nI've ridden public transit in other cities, and for its size, PGH should have a better system and lower fares.  For starters, the T (light rail) should be expanded to run east-west along the busways, given that it's currently a line to nowhere.", "My family and I got here at 7:45 pm on Thursday.  When we were taken to our seats near the back next to a large wedding table party and a another large party table, we sat and I immediately left the table and went to get some meat and seafood.  The line to get both were unbelievable-10 to 15 minute waits each.  I couldn't believe it!!  You wait in line to get in now you have to wait that long just to get meat & seafood for food that is already prepared.  Maybe it was the customers in line because I saw tons of workers in the preparation area.  Also, the seating in the restaurant was super cramped with very few aisle ways to get around.  Seemed like Caesars does care about the people's experience once the get inside the restaurant.  I paid $50+ for this!!  \\n\\nPositives:  I will say there was only 1 or 2 people in line when getting the hot crab legs so the wait was minimal if not quite fast.  The crab legs were cut in half making it super easy to eat, but the legs were small though.  there were no lines/minimal people at the salad and Asian food area.  I rarely eat desserts but my wife said the desserts were excellent.  I will say the lady taking care of our table was super.  She did a great job keeping our table clear and was proactive in refilling our drinks and giving us warm towelettes, almost anticipating our every move.\\n\\nHaving to stand in line for so long definitely impacted how I viewed the food.  I was alright.  Nothing special.  \\n\\nI guess people want to get their money's worth and skip everything but the seafood and carved meat.  I've seen good review about this place but based on my experience, my family and I will not be back.", "I should have done some research and read te reviews on Budget before booking! But I did book through Priceline and chose the cheapest option because I thought I only needed it to get my parents, brother and I to and from the airport.

The wait was about 15 minutes, still acceptable-no complaints. \\nRico was the associate who helped us. He deserves ZERO stars. He goes through half of the process without saying much then he asks would I just need basic coverage OR full liability coverage (or something equivalent). No option for no coverage, keep in mind. So instinctly I said basic, however after a few seconds I asked him if it was going to cost extra cause I won't need it if it was. He starts to give me his spiel and practically forces on me. He asks what insurance I have and what my deductible is and everything. I politely rejected his offer and he gives us the most horrible attitude. He just tells me to sign without telling me where, and after I signed in the wrong area, he just throws the paper back at me and asks me to sign again without pointing out where! My brother couldn't handle it anymore and starts arguing with him and that's when Rico pretends to be nicer. \\nThis is ridiculous. I don't know if Budget requires your associates to sell or if there is a big incentive. Either way, cut it out! It's annoying and gives your customers a bad experience!\\n\\nThe one star that they do deserve is their price. My family ended up staying an extra night and I had tried to call Budget to extend my rental but NO ONE ever picks up the phone. This was during business hours too. I even tried their 1-800 number and for some reason they couldn't help me.

I called my bank and disputed the charges (which could take 10 days) and they recommended working with management at Hanny's to cancel the charges, so the funds could be returned within the hour.

I still asked him to follow up, told him I'd appreciate his time, and reminded him we were talking about $220 here. He begrudgingly said he would and then didn't get back to me today. When I called, he obviously hadn't passed along the information to the other manager because he had zero knowledge of what had happened and the funds are still on hold 3 days later. \\n\\nHappy birthday, right?!

I was still expecting the best, after all the wait had to have been worthwhile, right? Wrong!

Last night we got our dinner to go, and it was pretty bad. We had the calamari appetizer, which has always been wonderful. Last night, it was undercooked, it was practically raw, and it smelled fishy. If we had been dining in, I would have returned it. I had my usual Falafal sandwhich, and it also wasn't very good. The Greek fries were soggy and limp, not crisp.  I don't know what was wrong, if it was just an off night, of if they are going downhill.

Good bathroom and room amenities\\n2. No Casino\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Staff cant handle busy days well\\n2. You might find bed sheets with holes in them (its supposed to be a 5 star hotel)\\n3. Noisy (you can hear sound from the pool or the Train even though you are on the top 5 floors)\\n4. Staff not trained to handle customer complaints properly. \\n5. No Casino\\n6. Near the railway line\\n\\nThe reason I chose Trump was that I expected it to be quieter, since it was away from the strip, alas I was so wrong. The train honks early in the morning everyday. The horn was loud enough to wake me up. I am light sleeper, but if you are sleeping at a 5 star hotel, on one of the top 5 floors you don't expect to hear outside noise.\\n\\nThe main thing that disappointed me was their customer service. When I complained regarding the same to their staff, the lady at the front desk told me that they could not move me since they were at capacity. She tried to prove to me that I was far away from the railway line and that I should not be hearing the train nor the pool music at all. She acted unapologetic and condescending and offered to send over ear plugs; couldn't stop stressing that they were going to be free of cost like she was doing me a big favor. Funny thing after all that, the ear plugs were never delivered.\\n\\nIcing on the cake was that next day I realized there were holes in my bed sheets. I even had the housekeeping clean my room after the first day use. This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel. How can you send torn sheets to my room!!!", "I ordered the Swiss Mushroom Burger but since I am very particular about how my beef is cooked I asked if it could be  medium rare and she said no problem. I dont like my beef over done. If it couldnt be cooked med rare I would have ordered something else but since that was no problem I went for it.    The burger came and it was very  well done.  While everyone else at my table ate I looked around for my server to tell her.  Finally the manager noticed I was looking around and came over to see if I needed anything.  I explained that the burger was too well done.  He asked me if I wanted another one.  By this time everyone else at the table was finishing up with their food so I said no. I had already waited for so long that I didn't want another one any more.  The bill came and they charged me for the burger that I didnt eat because THEY OVER COOKED IT.   The manager was surprised that I didnt want to pay for the over cooked food.  He said that the policy was that if they didn't take the food off the table then they don't take it off the bill.  If that is the policy why didnt he take it off the table? It was not how I wanted it. It was dry and unedible ad far as I was concerned.\\nThe server was nice, the manager was rude and unprofessional.  I would never go back to this place.

Problems with the kitchen, problems with the service, problems with the fact they're even open. The high point of this experience was waiting for my friend to show up, I stopped at the second hand store next door and didn't buy anything.\\n\\nAt this point, I don't care to remember what I ordered, I just remember trying to order it a 6 of 7 and the waitress scoffed at me and asked if I was sure I wanted it that spicy. \\\"\"You can always make it hotter, but can't make it less spicy.\\\"\" I guess that was true because I gave in and ordered it a 5. What I didn't realize was that the waitress meant to say I ordered a 5 on a scale of 1-100, cause this didn't have any spice at all. bleh...\\n\\nAfter a few bites I calmly explained that on a scale of 1 to 7 that my dish was more like a 0, no spice at all. Her response, if you really must know, she said, sorry, we just had a \\\"\"big order from a table of 6 people\\\"\" if you want the kitchen to re-make your order, it will be about 30 minutes. Instead of waiting for 30 minutes, I asked if she could bring me some thai chili peppers and some chili paste to add to my dish, I'd just take care of it myself instead; she showed up with chili oil and soy sauce. :-/ Thanks, I guess. I pushed through, spiced up my dish to satisfaction and 'enjoyed' the rest of my meal, but mostly the conversation with my friend and not really the meal or the dining experience. \\n\\nMy friends dish was pretty sub satisfactory to her, and she asked the waitress to just take it back. The waitress didn't seem to want to just take the dish from the table and leave it at that, after insisting on making a new dish to replace the unsatisfactory dish about five times. Instead of just returning the dish, she gave in to the waitress and selected something different. While her replacement dish was better, but not awesome, she ended up getting charged for the replacement dish she didn't really want to begin with.\\n\\nGiven the choice, next time I'll aim for taco bell.

Additionally, apparently either this joint has some kind of avant garde art school sandwich shit going on, or everyone was too occupied with taking gigantic bong rips in the walk-in fridge, because all of the sandwiches lacked a top piece of bread.

The line was endless and crowded. \\n\\nWe get seated and our waiter takes around 10 minutes for him to take our drink orders. Through dinner, he kept giving me my husband's drink, and his mine and our drinks were empty most of our dinner. We place our appetizer order in and ask if the baby's food can be brought out 1st. My husband orders the calamari and I ordered the lobster bisque. TWENTY FIVE MINUTES LATER (not exaggerating) we get the baby's food and our appetizers. The calamari was very good, but the lobster bisque could have used some cheese and salt. I wasn't all that impressed with it.\\n\\nWhile we are eating our appetizers, our salads come. Both of us ordered the cesar salad and it was the worst salad I had in a while. The salad dressing was very heavy on the anchovies and had a nasty taste to it. The croutons were homemade, yet extremely stale and chewy (if that's possible). It was so nasty, we didn't finish our salads.\\n\\n15 minutes after we FINISH our salads, the main course arrives on piping hot plates and placed IN FRONT of my infant daughter so she can burn herself. I ordered the Mediterranean seafood dish that had scallops, shrimp, lobster pieces, kalmata (sorry for the spelling) olive pieces, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, feta cheese, and risotto. I was very surprised to find out that my dish was actually really good. The flavors from the olives, the dressing that was put on it, and the seafood blended in really well. My husband ordered the filet minon medium rare, mashed potatoes, and zucchini medley. The filet minon was cooked medium with a very poor attempt of a holiendase sauce on top of the steak, it was tough to cut through, and the zucchini was not cooked all the way through. My husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it.\\n\\nDessert was a joke. I ordered cr\\u00e8me brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream. My dessert was not cooked all the way through and the strawberries that was served with it were very sour. It also came with banana bread muffins, but I was so fed up with my meal at that point I didn't bother with them. My husband had a little better luck with his than I did. The ice cream and sauce on the bottom of the dessert were alright, but the \\\"\"basket\\\"\" had sesame seeds on it and it completely threw off the taste. \\n\\nWe get our bill and come to find out it's $81. I scan through the bill and come to find out my daughters kiddie drink was full price at $2.25, her meal was a full price meal instead of the kiddie price like we were told it was at $8 and her kiddie ice cream (that was 2 HUGE scoops of half melted ice cream) was $4.95. We bring this up to our waiter (which that was the fastest he moved the whole night) and he told us there was nothing he could do and shrugged it off. Since we got that response, it was no use in complaining about our meals at all since we were going to get a nose snubbed at. \\n\\nIn general, we had a terrible go at it and I would not recommend this to anyone.", "Very rarely do I consider a meal so bad I want my money back and want to yell at the management.

Once I got the fork and tried my food, I was so disappointed with all of it. Got the Asiago Blue Mac, with port mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, chicken and caramelized onions. The cheese sauce tasted nothing like asiago or blue cheese. It was very bland and watery. Portion was small. The chicken was tough, the onions not caramelized and the mushrooms tasted old. No manager to be seen anywhere I left my meal half finished on the table. Great concept with terrible execution. Stay away till they work out the food flavor and quality issues. If you go, don't say I didn't warn you.", "The Ribs were fat and chewy, not real good.  Staff was friendly and the place was like a ghost town.  No one was in the place......  Second time in a row thae food was sub par!", "I was not greeted until I was about to leave out of the store, the lady ( said she was the owner ) at the register clearly saw me, as I was looking at some tanks right by the register, she said NOTHING until I was about to head out, that's when she wanted to ask if I was looking for anything in particular.  I actually wasn't I just wanted to see what they had to offer, being that it was my first time in the boutique.  I asked if she was the owner and she proudly stated that she is, and that she has another location as well.  \\n\\nEven if I would have received good customer service, this definitely isn't a store that I'd be out on the prowl for, the items seem a tad bit chintzy and out dated", "So I was a first timer today at Dickies.  Never been there had no idea how things were.  My first impression was horrid the guy named JOSEF had the worst attitude ever.  Yelled at me my friend and daughter saying \\\"\"Did I take your order yet? You need to move back here\\\"\" pointing two feet behind me. \\n\\nThis was our first time here and this meat slanging jerk was thriving as he yelled at us.  I immediately wanted to curse him out, luckily my child was present so the High Road it was.  The food taste like how JOSEF was on the inside,  Nasty, Bitter, Tasteless and Overcooked.  I had the Green Beans with bacon that bacon was old  it was disgusting, The  Beans Flavorless and well overcooked. The polish sausage another disappointment. \\n\\nIf you want BBQ go to Famous Dave's it might be a couple bucks more a plate but at least you will be treated kindly there.  I am still upset on how rude this guy was. Besides his nasty attitude the food was still horrible.  The worst Brisket ever.  Dry fatty and clumped and shredded.  Pulled pork not much better.    Management should consider terminating this employee he has major attitude and does not belong in customer service by any means.  JOSEF you are a major jerk and your attitude matches your face quite well.", "Just ordered thru their online ordering system, at 7:04 & said it was gona be $37. I got there at 7:20, only to find out that the total is $46.75 . Well this and this change and our online menu isn't updated, well that's no fair to me is what I thought but instead I just said oh okay. Then waited for 20more minutes and the guy had came over to me and said it'll be 5-10minutes can I offer you something to drink I said \\\"\"no why is it gona take longer when I ordered my food at 7, it's been 40 minutes.\\\"\" He said he'll go back and check. Meanwhile I'm sitting there thinking they probably started making my food when I got there, and plus they should have eaten up the difference in price, it wasn't my fault their online menu isn't up to date with their \\\"\"new menu\\\"\" in the resturant! And then I stood back up waiting by the desk only to have some lady who works there come over to me and ask can I help you, I said \\\"\"yes I wana know why it's taking 45 mins to make my food when these people right here just got here 10 mins ago and already have their food.\\\"\" She said they only have 1 sushi chef working and we are almost full and we are busy. I'm like \\\"\"it's never taken 45 mins,plus I see 2 sushi chefs working.. (Smh) and we come here all the time. I'm really upset that you are being so rude, & arguing with me, what are you gona do abt this.\\\"\"Again she said \\\"\"Im trying to explain why .. We're expanding and more busy\\\"\". And than finally my food came out by another lady - 50mins later!! I just was so hungry and upset that I just grabbed my bags and said I'm never coming back here. I'm upset because I love their food but HATE THEIR \\\"\"new\\\"\" SERVICE!  If they are expanding they better pick up their pace! \\n\\nTheir food is 4/5 star, new service blows !", "I had high expectations of this restaurant and was very disappointed. The food was mediocre (eggplant parmesan), does not come with pasta, service slim and salad is very poorly chosen greens. The tiramusu was good. I would not return to this restaurant or recommend it.", "Originally the food was awesome but it has steadily gone down hill.  The breakfast gig they were doing was great but it's inconsistent on when they actually open.  Showed up at 930am and still were not open.", "HORRIBLE small location, the only reason I gave 2 stars was that the view from the club was AMAZING!! Besides that the dance floor was small like in ur face small and just very badly placed hard to get in the dance floor and hard to get out.

It has never been any place I sought out.  In this case they had the advantage that they were not a McDonald's or Burger King, and they were open very late.\\n\\nI had the 7oz sirloin. It was adequate. Nothing special.  A little dry, and a bit gristley.  The mashed potatoes were nice, and the garlic broccoli was fine.\\n\\nThe onion rings were fine.  Nothing special.  The breading was nice, but didn't have much flavor.  The others seemed to like their wings and the pasta dish they had.  I was told \\\"\"three stars\\\"\" when I asked about them.

You might argue me up to 2.5 stars, but that's not an option on Yelp.\\n\\nMy wife did say the strawberry margarita was good (I didn't drink it).\\n\\nIf you have no choice, this place is OK.  Food is adequate, they have a happy hour, and they are open very late.  One of the better \\\"\"last resort\\\"\" options around midnight.", "Underwhelming. \\n\\nThe french onion soup could have had a deeper flavor, it was borderline bland. They cook it with a puff pastry on top. The puff pastry was slightly underdone and was slimy. The cheese on top that was cooked to a crisp was very good though. There were 2 pieces of foie gras in it, both of which were decent, although the flavor diluted. \\n\\nThe octopus salad was the worst octopus I've had. It was dry and tasteless. I sent it back and received the agnolotti. This was significantly better, but the pasta was a little thick. The mushrooms were very good. \\n\\nThe seared foie gras was very good. I liked the huckleberry but wasn't a fan of the samosa or carrot puree. \\n\\nMy friend's cod was very bland, while my other friend's branzino was cooked very well and flavored nicely. \\n\\nThere are better dining options in Vegas, and I definitely won't be back.", "You know you're broke when you even think about eating this. Marinara sauce tastes like it's cut with salsa, and the pizza crust tastes like it was brushed in margarine. Questionable all around, but it's even CHEAPER than Little Caesar's, so do you really have a right to complain?", "This was the third time my fiance and I have been here and we are never going back. Service has never been good. We have always gone to the bar. They are super friendly but when it ucomes to giving you service they are way under par. Food is decent and very good priced but after this last time where I had to send back my meal because it was too cold and took forever to even get them to ask us what we wanted to eat, I cannot give them another chance. Also had to constantly flag the bartender down for a new beer. But the final straw was the fact that we gambled about $70 between the 2 of us we only got 2 beers comped. As someone in the service industry and works as a cocktail server and has bartended, I know what the proper comp system is. Had no compensation for having to wait at least 15 min for my new meal as well.. We've had problems the last 2 times as well but tried to give them a chance since they are new (and very close to home) but not after this time. So sad:(", "The employees here are not helpful and love to follow you around the store like you are stealing all their products.  Once you're done it's a burden for them to ring you up. Have questions, don't bother asking, they have no clue. It is one of the cleaner stores I've been in, thus the two stars.", "The food sucked. We left extremely unsatisfied, especially considering that we were super hungry coming in (it wouldn't have taken much to please us). Paid $55 for a meal we didn't finish. Did I mention I was super starving?\\n\\nOrdered the garlicky butter bake because my boyfriend loves garlic. Turned out to be a disaster. The dish came out much smaller than expected (unlike the picture shown).  The lobster wasn't cleaned, had no flavor, and the meat was way too soft and fell apart. The one small cluster of snow crab legs we got was missing a leg. The corn was bland. The mussels weren't good, either. The garlic flavor leaned towards bitterness... The garlic bread was okay though. \\n\\nAlso got the skillet paella. It mostly tasted like tomatoes, even with the seafood in it. The worst part was broken pieces of mussel shells were scattered throughout. Unappealing and unappetizing. Like the garlicky butter bake, the best part of the dish was the two pieces of garlic bread (which wasn't even that great).\\n\\nWe were actually here sometime last year and the food wasn't so bad then. I don't know if they changed chefs or what, but it's safe to say that we definitely won't be returning here anytime soon. \\n\\nI'm only giving two stars because service was pretty decent -even though they didn't ask us how our food was. I guess they already knew the answer.", "Terrible staff, especially Casey a promoter. We told him we wanted on the guest list, no on a table. Why would we spend at least a grand for cobra starship. Anyway he says it's fine come on down. We arrive, he puts us in a line. 15 mins later he pushes us to get a table.  I'm not sure if he understands English or not but how much clearer do we have to be. He also talks about how much better 1oak is now that they got rid of ghetto elements, I'm assuming he meant blacks and minorities. We got tired of his bullshit and left the line to go waste our money at another establishment. Funny how when we left the line the people behind us went right in, a bunch of white guys and fat white girls (not that I have anything against white folks).  Seriously the club is in the middle of an aging hotel with a bunch of 50+ old people in line. They should be begging us poor minorities to use our fresh platinum cards at their club.", "I worked here for a few months (August until two days ago).  I was fired on a very contrived reason - I think it was because this place doesn't get enough business.\\n\\nLocation is pretty bad for visibility, even if it's convenient to campus.  Food is very average, but I like it more than, say Panda Express.  My parents run a restaurant so I have experience (which is why I was hired in the first place) - this is one of the most inefficiently-run restaurants ever.  The vegetable dishes are good, though, and the Chinese-language menu is generally good quality if you don't mind a wait.  The bosses both cook when necessary, but it's best to come during weekdays, when the main cook is in.  The hot pot is also fairly popular, but most of the meats are frozen.  Other things that are frozen include the \\\"\"Wheaten Foods\\\"\" menu (potstickers, wontons, and meat buns).  I think that's pretty SOP here in CU, though.\\n\\nPortion sizes are okay.  They definitely shrank in the 3 months I worked there.  I won't analyze pricing, because I'm not used to eating out, but I think most people consider them fair or just slightly overpriced.\\n\\nThings to not get include the highly-Americanized items on the menu, especially those with breaded chicken in them.  The quick lunch was phased out mostly - now it's a selection of two Chinese braised dishes, so they keep pretty well (and have an average turnover).  Instead, they now offer \\\"\"Combos,\\\"\" which are your standard rice and a main dish, with an egg roll.  They used to give a soda with these, but now only offer iced tea, hot tea, or a small bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup.  Don't get the soups (including noodle soups) or appetizers unless you really like egg rolls (they're decent but nothing special).  Certain dishes like the pork with mustard greens (P10, IIRC) are frozen, but I think they're probably okay if you don't mind them defrosting/reheating via microwave.  The smoothies and bubble tea are a no-no - they're edible and not too terrible, or so I hear, but go to Evo's or some other place for these; the slushies are okay if you don't mind a lot of sugar.  Most customers seem okay with the fish, but it doesn't look too great to me (aka it smells, and fresh fish doesn't).  To qualify that last statement, it doesn't reek like rotten fish, but you can definitely get a stronger smell than I think is usual when you gut one (I bass fish at home and clean my own catch) - plus, while it's inevitable, it's frozen and quick-defrosted (aka in the sink, in a water bath with direct contact, rather than through a bag).  Hardly sanitary).\\n\\nLike some other reviews have stated, they really do skimp as much as possible on ingredients, equipment, etc.  Ingredients come in on Thursday nights from Far East, and I'm not sure when other ingredients come in.  However, I'd say to come on Friday, because they probably push the old vegetables on Thursday (I only worked TR lunch and Sundays, so I can't say for certain).\\n\\nA few big points about the owners' behavior (which they also try to instill in the workers): first, they will try to dissuade you from getting something that they feel is too much trouble to cook at the moment, never mind if they have all the ingredients ready (usually this is because it's busy); secondly, they do cut corners, as aforementioned.  Another thing that most people probably aren't too concerned about because they aren't very aware of it, is the matter of the \\\"\"special soup.\\\"\"  They only give it to regular customers, but more generally to any Chinese or Chinese-speaking customers.  If you're not Chinese/speaking-proficiency or a repeat customer who asks, tough luck (I've seen this attitude referred to on foodie blogs as \\\"\"soup Nazism\\\"\").  A last point on their behavior is that they will lie about what they have and don't have, especially when it comes to drinks or if they feel they're too busy to bother with your order.  Normally this happens with drinks (they keep changing their Combo meals, and they decided to stop giving sodas with them because they didn't want to stock up); they will also refuse to make you a smoothie or other blended drink if they're busy.\\n\\nBasically, they have an undersized facility, an undertrained staff (one of the bosses in particular gets in the way more than he keeps things going), an undersized staff, and basically a very mediocre business model.  I'm kind of astounded they've survived, but if you know what to get, you can get a pretty decent meal here.\\n\\nTo conclude, there aren't a lot of repeat customers, but they try to treat the ones they recognize well.  However, I went to Cravings with a friend yesterday, and I saw a lot of former customers that stopped coming there.  I'd say they made a good choice (Cravings has much better service, food, and atmosphere).  Other good Chinese restaurants in the area, in no particular order, include Mandarin and Lai-Lai.  The Wok in Mahomet is legendary among the Chinese on campus, but that's another story", "A sad name! \\nNo beach, no swimming!\\nWhat is the point in 110 degrees?\\n\\nReflective, the only thing reflective is all the concrete.

On the way out, a man who just brought a tiramisu before me walked in with a box of crushed tiramisu that even worst than mine.

I will never know what they taste like, but I do remember what Aloha Kitchen's ribs tasted like and they were off the hook!\\n\\nI give this location a 2 because I was dissapointed in the battered shrimp. At other L&L locations it came without the batter. Another reason why they get a 2 is because of KRaZie amount of styrofoam they use, the place has two tables and five booths, and the guy working the front counter seemed a little out of sorts.\\n\\nAlthough the review could have been better, I will definitely be back. It's literally 3 minutes from my hale and better than them fast food joints.", "I wanted to love this place. Maybe I'm still hangry at it for leaving me dissatisfied.  I order the Best Dam sandwich without coleslaw. I'm not a fan of mayonnaise.  My husband ordered the pastrami and we got a chili cheese dog for baby.  The food took FOREVER.  I watched someone who had ordered before us - get there order, eat, and leave before our food had even arrived. I didn't realize it takes so long (especially since they have a drive-thru). My sandwich came smothered in mustard and mayonnaise (two things I really don't care for). I didn't even bother eating it. The mustard and mayonnaise were not listed as items on the sandwich or I would have ordered accordingly.  My husband said his sandwich was ok and the chili dog was basic. There are better options in BC.", "Meh .. staff is very short assy but overall clean.. what do you expect it's Mc Donalds not Deluxe Burger at the Biltmore... place is dated I rarely eat here kids had gift cards from Christmas....management needs to look closely at this location", "We went to the Bistro Buffet at the Palms so I could get my once every six months craving for buffet out of the way. I like to try different ones each time since it's really about getting to eat as many different tasty things at once. Frankly, I'm glad I won't be experiencing the Bistro again.\\n\\nMy biggest problem was that the food was bland. Nothing had spices, or even just salt and pepper. My second problem was that there were about 6-7 options for barbecued meats, and not a lot else for meat. I could have overlooked this but again, the barbecue sauce was not very flavorful.\\n\\nThe final problem with this buffet had to do with service. Both times I tried to get carved meat, no one was there. I waited the second time for about 3-4 minutes, and no one every offered to help me, even though they were nearby. They also keep very few pies sliced and waiting. Instead, you have to wait for someone to slice is for you. For some pies this is nice as it keeps them cool, but the apple pie was downright cold, and would have benefited from sitting out of the cooler. The only good service we got was from our waitress, who kept our six cups full, and our dirty plates picked up.\\n\\nThe only saving grace for me was the baklava, a special dessert for the night. If you like snow crab legs, they looked good, but no one at my table wanted to try them.\\n\\nOverall, the Bistro Buffet is not worth leaving the Strip for if you are visiting. The buffets at Wynn and the Cosmo are better, even if they do cost more. For locals, I would put the Bistro Buffet about on par with any Station Casino buffet, and we all know how those can go.\\n\\nOne tip for saving some money, anyone with the Palms players card gets a discount if they pay in cash so that can save you a few buck.", "Went here with my boyfriend and his daughter because his co-workers raved about it...Either we cam on a bad night or their tastes in food is whack.  Anyway, was so excited when my boyfriend said they had these awesome (sounding) Grilled Cheese sandwiches.  I chose the bacon and pear.  My boyfriend got a burger and so did his daughter.  We also the the app with all the diff fried veggies.  For drinks I got an Angry Orchard cider (wanted a heff but server said they don't have any... really??) My boyfriend go some other cider thing. and then since it was Sunday and their Bloody Mary's were $5, I decided to have one of those too (it was a rough day).\\n\\nSo let's start with the app.  Most of the veggies and cheese curds were pretty good (pickles, green beans, not sure about the Okra because I don't like it, but the BF and his daughter ate 'em.  The corn fritter things tasted like corn and raw pancake batter on the inside.  Some of the smaller cheese curds were like rubber.  The spicy aoli was good, the taziki was whack.  It was not smooth with chunks of cucumber or just smooth is was like they put the cukes in a food processor and threw them in a cup.  It was just weird.\\n\\nThe cider was good and so was the ale/cider thing my bf got.  the Bloody Mary was horrible.  Mix was thin and watery (f it was a mix) didn't have that \\\"\"zing\\\"\" to it, just blech.\\n\\nThe Food.  The server said they cook their burgers \\\"\"pink\\\"\" in the middle and that is how he likes them.  Nope, well done.  Secondly, his buns were BLACK like completely burnt.  Who lets that get out of the kitchen, huh?  They do.  His daughters was very dark too, but she was hungry so she just ate it that way, he asked for diff buns.  My grilled cheese.  First off, it was toasted bread.  Not yummy, buttery, crispy, crunchy deliciousness you expect from a grilled cheese.  No oozing cheese (supposed to have Brie, Blue Cheese and Cheddar) no brie, no blue.  I asked the manager(?) when he brought out my bf's plate with new buns and asked him about the cheese conundrum.  I opened the sandwich and told him to look.  He says, \\\"\"there is a some blue cheese right there (it was the size of the tip of pencil lead).  He also told me that they don't put a lot of brie or blue because they are very strong and pungent cheeses.  Brie is strong and pungent???  And yes, blue is and I love it, so I want the flavors come out in the sandwich.  That grilled cheese was $9.00! I was very very dissapointed.  I make WAY better grilled cheese and it doesn't cost me $9.00.  The waffle cut fries were gross but I DID love their sweet potato fries, and they did taste homemade.  Service was great!  The bill was almost $70.00 for that crap, never again.  Even his daughter said she didn't want to come back and she isn't a food snob like my bf and I.  Sorry Spokes on Southern, looks like you gotta flat.", "If zero was an option this place would get -4 stars. It is typically slow but tolerable cause it's pretty tasty but no more!! I just returned home after having left a drive thru for the first time ever without my food. I waited 13 minutes and 1 car had gotten food and there were 4 cars ahead of me...4 ahead of me!!! I know they wouldn't claim to be fast food but nobody has time to wait 40 minutes in a drive thru. Go down to 35th Ave.", "I will never be visiting this Macaroni Grill again. I booked my company's intimate holiday party here, reserved the private room and decided the 4 course meal was perfect for our event. When we arrived, the hostess had no idea that we had a reservation. We were finally taken to the back room where there were 4 individual tables set up to hold 10 people each. I had requested place settings for 20 and hoped to have one large table, but our group had to split up. We sat down to find the full menu in front of us and when I went and spoke to the manager about our condensed 4 course menu, she said they placed the wrong menus down. I already felt upset that I had confirmed this appointment 2 times and it was not put together, but tried not to let it ruin my experience. Our server was all over the place and should NOT have been waiting on a private party. One of our guests had to ask multiple times for an item because it had been continuously forgotten. The delicious bread with oil and pepper everyone is talking about did not happen; we were given bread and there was olive oil bottles on the table, but no plates, no pepper, nothing. We were each suppose to receive an appetizer, instead they brought out one of each kind for the table to share. Overall, the service and \\\"\"lack of communication\\\"\" (words from the manager herself) really turned this dinner into an unorganized and stressful night.", "The food wasn't very good. My girlfriend and I could only eat like a quarter of meal before we asked for a boxes (just to be nice, we don't plan on eating them). We then drove across the street to McDonalds.  I would like to note the waiter was super nice but that doesn't really help later when your stomach hurting. I hope it was just the dishes we ordered (spicy chicken w/ red sauce and chicken with vegetables in spicy sauce) because ironically the restaurant ambiance was very cozy and all the staff was extremely nice.", "Oooooh noooo.  Had such high expectations and was so disappointed.  Loved the movie Serendipity and the outdoor pink patio looked so cool and fun that they suckered us into coming.\\n\\nOur story.... we came in for a late lunch.  Right upfront the waitress mentioned that it will be a while before we get our food because they are busy.

Once we finished eating, we finally caught the waitress and asked about our salad... she apologized and said she would take it off the bill.  Take it off the bill????  Wow.... how generous of her considering we never received it!  \\n\\nIt was comical because when she said that, she was acting as if she was going to do us a huge favor by not charging us for that salad.\\n\\nIn addition, she had no sense of personal space....not sure if she was hard at hearing or what, but when we were ordering, she was leaning down right in our faces.... It was very annoying.\\n\\nAbout the food.... bland!  Our hamburger was dry, the soda was flat and seriously, the cookie dough sundae could be made at home and it would have tasted much better than theirs.  Seriously overpriced.  Months before, I tried the Carl's Jr. hamburger version of what we ordered here and let me tell you, Carl's Jr. was a 10 on a 1 to 10 scale and this was a 1.\\n\\nThere are so many delicious restaurants to choose from in Vegas so I am shocked as to how little they care about good service and food here.\\n\\nI think it is a good idea to look at Yelp before going into a restaurant because if you see the average is 3 out of 5 stars, its safe to assume that nearly half the people weren't satisfied.

My uncle went in to pick it up the next day and informed them that he has liability insurance and he didn't want the damage waiver. Christal told him that it was NEVADA STATE LAW to either have the damage waiver or their own insurance.  She said they can call their insurance company to add collision insurance and cancel it after they return the car or get the damage waiver.  Because he thought it was the LAW he got the damage waiver.  I looked on their website which it states that damage waiver is completely OPTIONAL, so I called Christal and she told me it was a gray area and in Nevada it was STATE LAW.  She then said they could have gotten the car without the damage waiver but the manager would require a deposit for the full amount of the vehicle! I asked if all the Enterprises were like that and she said yes.  I called another Enterprise and they said damage waiver is OPTIONAL and there is NO DEPOSIT needed even if you only have liability insurance.  I called back and spoke with the manage Daniel who told me that Christal was just saying liability insurance is Nevada State Law, if that was the case then why would he need to call his insurance company??? Daniel then told me a fake story of a customer that wrecked a car and didn't have insurance so he had to pay $5000 out of pocket! Really?!? Enterprise, the largest car rental company in America doesn't have secondary insurance on their fleet of vehicles? That is the risk of rental car business, so I am sure their cars are insured! Daniel then tells me we can come back and get our money back since my uncle has a major credit card and that usually has insurance for rental cars.  Sure enough we call Mastercard and it IS covered.

When I'm in the mood for them, they are fantastic. So when my mother and aunt came to visit da Burgh for the first time they were intensely curious about local restaurants, and this one came up. They thought it sounded fun and different, but since one is pescatarian leaning to the veg side, and the other is gluten intolerant, I really didn't think Primanti would be the best place to take them.\\n\\nWalking around down town we passed this one, and they wanted to sit down and give it a try. It was a beautiful day so we sat outside, which was really amazing. We were also amazed by our server. By the end of the meal, we were amazed she remembered to show up at work at all. In fact, its a distinct possiblility that she didn't ever work there, and was just confused and thought she was at the greek place across the square. You don't go to a sandwich shop to be blown away by your server, but there is a minimum standard you should aspire to, and she was far off that mark.\\n\\nShe took forever to get there, but it was no hardship sitting outside on a beautiful day with two of my favorite gals. We talked about the menu, Auntie decided to order anything with no bread, with some loaded fries. Mom wanted a sardine sandwich, but only if its the sardine filets, she doesn't like the kind with bones. She is not one to make a fuss, so figured cheese and egg would be fine too. \\n\\nWhen she came around for drinks, they got a water and a pop. I asked if she had PBR, and she replied she didn't know. Then continued to stand there, pen in hand, ready to write my drink order down. OK then, how about I just have a diet pop. Before she ran off, we ordered our meals. I asked her if the sardines have bones in them or not. She looked up from her note pad and looked at me with a look that said {insert foul insult here} and shrugged. A big, slow, deliberate shrug. Not a word. And then just stood there waiting to write my order down. After a good, long, awkward pause, she said \\\"\"I don't know.\\\"\"  All three of us just looked back at her, waiting, until eventually she sighed, held her pad down by her side, and with a big roll of the eyes, asked if I wanted her to check. Yes. Please do.\\n\\nSo then she ran off, and started running food out to tables all around and refilling drinks. Running the sandwiches, she would grab two or three tables at a time, and then put all the sandwiches down, sort of paw through them to see what was what, and leave theirs and take the rest. It was just strange.\\n\\nShe came back, and without looking up announced \\\"\"Don't matter, we are out of sardines anyways.\\\"\"Facepalm! From the length of time she had been inside the restaurant, I doubt she even asked. Mom, very uncomfortable that her question had become such a horrible inconvenience, asked for egg and cheese. Auntie ordered loaded fries to start, then her corned beef with no bread. The waitress told her she already gets fries with her sandwich, but she wanted them anyways. I got balogna, just because neither of them would ever guess what jumbo means.\\n\\nOf course, the order came out quickly, and wrong. Mine was fine the way it came, but not what I asked for. Mom was the same. Auntie was fine, but no loaded fries every showed up. Until we got the check, that's where they were. Getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server. \\n\\nMy Aunt picked up lunch, and left the tip. I don't know what she left, but I think that probably amazed the server as much as her server amazed us. All in all, I reckon she enjoyed our lunch together just as much as we did.", "I wish I could give them a 0! \\nMy husband & I arrived for our anniversary dinner. We've had the last 2 anniversary dinners here so were excited. We realized very quickly that Satara is under different ownership. We asked for the chicken satay.....and they didn't have any. We then went straight to our entrees. My husband ordered the beef & broccoli, which was ok, the broccoli was boiled and then stir fried. I ordered the spicy spaghetti noodles, but asked for them to be with the wide rice noodles. Well I received the spaghetti noodles, and not the wide rice noodles. I was about half way through the dish, and found a cracked piece of shell in my mouth. I showed it to the waiter and he apologized and stated it was a mussel shell. At this point I did not care what it was, I just know it should not have been in my dish. They refunded 10% of the price of the dish.....and offered to make it again for me. I passed as the flavors were not as good as before and I didn't trust them to eat another bite.

I apparently have a very different ideal, based on quite enjoyable meals at the Nest in Portland, Art of the Table in Seattle, the Chicken and the Egg in Atlanta, Allim in Great Barrington, which I've reviewed as well as number of other dining establishments all the way to the iconic Chez Panisse  in Berkeley.  I'm a Farmer's Market, Farm to Table cook who prefers chickens from my local small farmer butchered the previous day and greens picked from my garden in time for dinner, tomatoes that haven't had the flavor dulled by refrigeration.\\n\\nA previous reviewer described FnB as follows:\\n\\nThis would be an ideal place if you:\\n1) Care about what goes in your body; health conscious yet still a big foodie\\n2) Love vegetables\\n3) And desserts (how can you not?)\\n4) Prefer an Intimate, quiet ambiance\\n5) Look forward to Farm to Table, beautifully concocted and creative dishes \\n\\nTo this I would say:\\n1) I care about what I eat and enjoy good ingredients well prepared.\\n2) I  rate restaurants on how well they prepare vegetables more than what they do with the protein entree.   I was a vegetable breeder and know how good they can be when bred for eating rather than long haul transportation and processing.\\n3) Desserts?  It seems rather counter to caring about what goes in your body to dump sugar into it, but heh, if it floats your boat, why ever not?\\n4) I greatly prefer an intimate quiet ambiance, not the loud cacophony of high ceilings with nothing to break up the sound and the room crowded with people trying to be heard.  We couldn't hear each other, let alone the wait staff. \\n5) The dishes were indeed creative, and beautifully concocted.  The food quality going into the dishes was less than expected, vegetables included.  The steak was nothing like our usual grass finished dry aged  beef and the chicken was tough and lacked the distinct chicken flavor of our local pastured fryers.  I'm not sure where the Farms are that FnB sources  for their Table.  I certainly haven't seen any driving into the Phoenix area. Perhaps they are doing the best they can with what they can source in the desert.\\n\\nThe lager was sweet and the by the glass wine selection is  limited to AZ and NM wines, which I find too sweet to drink.

Then the manager came out and said all the multi-grain and wheat pancakes are always dry, I said they should put that on the menu - multi-grain pancakes always dry.  Then I tried the blueberry pancakes, well it must not have been a pancake day as the blueberry pancakes tasted funny, all the blueberries were right in the middle of the pancakes and they too were dry and pasty.

The early table was a pleasant surprise but it was obvious they weren't really keen at estimating accurate wait times.\\n\\nOur server was friendly but not attentive. There were a number of times we had to wait a while before he returned to our table.\\n\\nThe Shepard's pie was bland and not very tasty at all.  The portion was very small, which wouldn't be a big deal if they weren't charging nearly $30. It was an entree price with a tapas/small plate portion size.

For entrees I ordered the Reuben, which was yummy, but came with sad chips, and my boyfriend ordered the burger - it was PATHETIC!

The love seat when delivered had a soft spot in the left cushion. So, after Christmas I called their piss poor customer service line who said it was company policy to send out a repair man, and they were not making an exception. I went to the store and talked to the manager and complained and they replaced it and I was happy.\\n\\nAfter 3 months, the sofa had a cushion that formed a soft spot to the point that it was hard to get out of that seat. I followed company policy and called customer service and they sent out an independent repair man who took pictures and said that he did not know what the company would do but that someone would call me to let me know. He recommended getting replaced because it was so new. Well, no one called me for a few days and when they did, it was a follow up call to ask how my service was. I said nothing had been done, and the rep told me the case was closed because from the pictures the sofa looked fine. So I went back to the store and talked to the manager, who said they would have to attempt to fix it. A different independent repair man shows up a few days later and stuffed pieces of foam between the metal springs and the seat cushion, that was his professional \\\"\"fix\\\"\". Remember this furniture is only 3 months old so I went back to the store and after some serious discussion, they said they would replace this piece. I told them I didn't want to go down that road again because this furniture was junk. What I really wanted was my money back but I know that would never happen so I asked if they would exchange it for something of better quality. After some back and forth with the manager and threatening to call 12 for action, they said they would but they would but they wanted another $800 and I would lose the extended warranty. We settle for 2 leather power reclining pieces and one non reclining with no additional money out of my pocket, no extended warranty, and 3 pieces that my wife hates!\\n\\nIf that isn't enough, 10 months after dropping $3500 at this furniture store.

He then realized from the nutritional menu I picked up that the fries were not gluten free so he couldn't eat them.\\n\\nI had a veggie burger with cheese and mushrooms.  I almost couldn't eat it.  It was the worst veggie burger I had ever had.  I also tried the cheese curd - a mix of yellow and white cheese, deep fried and they offered me packets of BBQ sauce or ranch to dip them in.

The beef and broccoli is always terribly overcooked, rendering the broccoli pretty much inedible. In fact, their vegetables across the board are usually overcooked and utterly bland. \\nI do like the BBQ pork, the beef fajitas and the pork asada.

We called the front desk at 6pm, we called again at 3am, and finally the bathroom was cleaned up around 4am. The hotel would only return a petty $44 resort fee, rather than refund the night and gave me the go-around with the third party booker (lasvegas.com). I couldn't find a way to directly reach the manager by email, so why not let them know in the open how terrible the customer service was.

I LOVE proscuitto and the ingredients for the pizza sounded simple yet delicious especially w/ fresh mozarella.\\n\\nTook about 20 mins for the pizza. I liked the crust, it was thin and crispy. The ratio of ingredients to sauce was on spot. However, I felt the pizza was way too oily. Proscuitto was drenched in oil and very salty. The arugula was good and didn't have that bitterness to it. There also weren't too much mozzarella :( Overall I don't think I'd come here again to pay $20 for the exact same pizza I could get at pieology. Well you can't get proscuitto at pieology, but the crust and everything else tasted the same.", "Awful service.

Got another deal, not as good as LVH offered but did come back just a few days ago, December 27th 2014 and like so many other reviews, I have to agree with a lot of what they are saying. Granted, I guess this whole timeshare resort thing might make things different later on but in the meantime, the annoyance of the greeters for the darn timeshare was a big turnoff this trip. \\n\\nThe slot machines were not in abundance to begin with when LVH, but it was good enough, however, this trip, several machines were taken out, pretty skimpy now, not many choices. Table games took over and I am not a table player so who knows, maybe this will work but while playing slots, had to listen to construction going on for this International Bar they were madly trying to get built probably for New Years Eve, but all the dust and whatnot from them working all night hours did a number on my allergies, air ventilation not good at all in there like other casinos I have been in. \\n\\nNot many cocktail waitresses coming around either while playing, was way better before when it was LVH.\\n\\nAnd this was the worst thing, after telling friends who had never stayed there how good the buffet was, I was so disappointed in how the buffet changed. It was still good and we got it free BUT it was way better before, more great choices and now just mediocre in my opinion AND no more free beer or wine with your dinner which was a great idea especially since this hotel is still looking old. Until it gets completely done, I really think making people pay this resort fee is not ok at all. \\n\\nI hope they put new soundproof connecting doors in the rooms because my husband didn't sleep at all first night nor did our friends because you can hear people next to you thru that door. Bed was ok, not that comfy, better in other rooms we got there before. Our friends also were given a room that was not clean at all so they had to move but then due to the partiers next door to them who were so loud and security didn't seem to want to take care of, they moved at 2:00 am to yet another room. Second night they called for extra blanket and it took a good 45 minutes or so to get it. \\n\\nI have stayed at Treasure Island many times and was starting to be ok with LVH and liking it, but I have to say it doesn't even compare to TI now and at TI, I can go across street to other hotels/casinos much easier and the rooms and beds are the best. \\n\\nPlease bring the old buffet back Westgate and maybe have some kiosks again like LVH did giving you some freebies, like coffee or something. \\n\\nI will hope that it gets better but this timeshare pushing stuff really does turn me off so would have to be really good deals to get me back.", "This restaurant was recommended by a friend yesterday for their happy hour and fish tacos.

Fleming's--anywhere, my fish taco was fine for $3.00, although the bartender told me it would be salmon, it was some type of white fish, Bill ordered the shrimp taco---blackened, so very salty, we could not eat it!!!  The fries were also very spicey and you could only eat the top layer so as not to get all the spice.  All in all one of the very worst dining/happy hour experiences we have had in the 10 years we have lived here.  Do the owners have any idea of their competition and the market out there?!!  I would suggest do not even try this place!", "It was my first time getting anything from this place, and considering that I'm Mexican I figured I would be lenient on this place since I knew it was going to be whitewash Mexican food, so I called my order in (Pollo Asado, and 2 tacos) and the guy told me it would be about 20 minutes. I only live like a block away so after 15 minutes I strolled on down there. When I walked in, no one really greeted me or even took notice, so after about 5 minutes someone finally asked me if I had been helped, I told the girl I came to pick up my order. They said it would be right up, but I proceeded to wait another 45 minutes. While I was waiting I got to observe the prep cooks continually texting with their gloves on and then go back to preparing peoples salads, and guacamole, Yuk!  Finally I got my food and rushed home only to realize that I got a mediocre piece of chicken with BBQ sauce on it? WTF I thought this was Mexican food? The tacos were ridiculously tiny, and the meat was cold! I'll never set foot in this place ever again. .

I gave up half way through.\\nThe French fries were completely covered in salt as well. \\nAll the ingredients looked superb, just ruined by a pound of salt per plate.

Not true. They do have a large selection of compound bows but recurve selection is very limited. They did have some quality recurve bows at competitive prices.

We even had time to look through the entire store before he finally came to us. When he did come to us his advice was short, rushed, rude and perhaps more importantly, contradictory to most everything I have studied and been taught by the very guy who recommended this store. This employee even went as far as to say he did not have time to work with us because they were busy. There were 2 other people in the store and they were looking around. Regardless, at 10am on a Saturday they should have more employees available. NOT MY FAULT. A prior review advised Archery Headquarters was condescending. Yes. A very true description. Condescending but I also want to emphasize that their condescension is not even warranted because their advice was inaccurate. \\n\\nMy friend and I wanted to leave, regardless of his attitude, when we recognized his inaccurate advice but we are patient and wanted to give hime a chance to win back our business. When he straight-out told us he didn't have time for us, however, we politely thanked him for his time and got the heck out.

The \\\"\"rush\\\"\" on his daily glasses took 5 weeks! We asked about compensation and the answer was \\\"\"oh I'm sorry but we cannot give you a discount\\\"\", just the apology! We will NEVER be back!!", "For our delivery they said 35 minutes, which turned into 103 minutes before we got our food. The owner was apologetic, and recooked and delivered our order.   He said they have a new delivery person who got lost.  \\n\\nThankfully the food tasted good.  So they regained a star with that.  I am not sure if we will try this location again after the long wait...  even though the food was pretty tasty.", "It's probably just the area, but this location is one I try to avoid.  It's just kind of dirty and low-quality all around.  If you're in this area and need a post office, it probably won't pay to drive farther.  But don't come here by choice.", "This is the worse Walmart I have ever visited. The management staff DOES NOT staff the store. If you need help, you will wait for 30 minutes or more. Dirty store and always out of stock on the items you want. Also check the diary products as many are outdated. Very sad for a Walmart!", "I'm beginning to think Yelpers in Arizona have been so deprived of good ethnic food that they think every mediocre hole in the wall is worthy of 4-5 stars. On the plus side, the owner is a kindly old gent, my waiter was very attentive, and their prices are low.  Unfortunately, the food (I had a chicken dish) was just really fair at best. The spare ribs were AWFUL and nothing at all like Chinese pork! The ribs were brown meat cooked in a salty brown sauce that tasted like eating burned pot roast and some parts were too tough to chew. The hot and sour soup was just lame, barely tangy and no pork thrown in for flavor. I really think Panda Express is a lot better than this.", "This place is overpriced, has a limited selection, the service is slow even when empty and they seat everyone on top of each other. Really really terrible. Highly re come d skipping this one.", "Very disappointing.  I have been going to Nora's since '94.  It has slowly gone downhill from then.  I recently had a 8 pm appointment and took a date.  I checked in at 7:50 but wasn't seated until 8:25, and then right behind the hostess podium.  Good business, as usual, can bring a business down.  I'm done.", "I ate here with my sister and I had the Philly deluxe and onion rings, onion rings were pretty good, the sandwich not so much it had a lot of  Grisel it was pleasant lol  and the cheese sauce didn't have much flavor. The service was good  and it came out fast but overall the food wasn't great to me.", "We haven't been impressed with the donuts here. They are much more doughy than we like and the maple icing on the maple bar doesn't have much flavor. We've definitely had better donuts elsewhere.", "I lived here from 2013 to 2014 and from what i hear on the reviews everybody is so right. Now this place has it pros and if you are into the party seen hard then Old town Scottsdale is real nearby. the go carts ride through out the day and night to pick you up and bring you downtown which is great, also the views are nice if you like to see women run by in the jogging mode, Makes you want to work out. The maintenance team is really great and will come to your place no later than 24 hours to fix your issue. Also u have Scottsdale Community College and Talking Stick Casino real close by. The pool scene is also nice if u like to party just make sure u get there to get that 1 cabana, its more like a first come first serve. The cons out weight the good in every way. \\n\\nFirst of all there is a lot of dog poop lying around. a few owners don't care to much of picking it up in which sometimes the maintenance guys will step up and do it. When i first moved here i liked it a lot but once a new company bought the property, to me it fell to crab. Before MAA took rights of it. u receive a separate bill for your water/trash and sewage and honestly it was cheaper compare to MAA twist to it. Also the cable was free it was included with your rent but somehow we never got a real idea of what MAA connect ($45) is and to me it seems like  they figure since they are getting free cable we will charge them for it on the low and that's how it feels. Pretty messed up but you pay for your location. Also im from the south and i have travel and live in a lot of apartments but my gosh. This area is a cop haven, no disrespect to the Police Department in Scottsdale but since it is no ghetto's are hoods in Scottsdale they prey on there fancy shopping mall and there DUI enforcement is crazy. i never seen cops posted outside the club and prey on which person to get instead of getting patrons out and clearing the area they are trying to get u jail time fa real. To me that's not good when u intentionally prey on people to mess up.  I agree with Aimee that they do not give you time to pay your rent. Its due on the 1st and that's it, no exceptions, If u are later that's $75.00 and $10.00 every other day. \\n\\nI never understood why the 1st and not the 5th, give people time to get the money too u. Also the leasing office has change so much till its a real shame i moved in and Lorrie was the manager and she was really great, when she left she passed me on to Amber if i needed anything come see her and next thing you know she doesn't work there anymore. I know everybody has to move on but i feel like its so messed up in there they cant keep nobody in there.  Also when they put notes on your door to have to come inside on a certain date why is the notes 48 hours. They don't give you time to get your place in order especially if you have a dog and you work odd shifts. Another thing is this place is not cater to the 2nd shift worker with 2 cars. if you have your nice car under your carport and don't want to move it because you feel safe with it there as for as getting bang on with nicks and stuff. and you drive your 2nd car around. be very cautious getting home anytime after 9pm there will not be a parking spot which pretty much u will be parking on the street and walking to your place just a word of thought. And lastly this place will recruit you to moved in but let me warn u, moving out is a b%%%^ my rent was suppose to be $90 for the last month rent, I go to paid it online and bam i get a bill for $230, the apartment tells me Oh see what happen was you been bill for your water/sewer/ trash/ and MAA Connect fee for the months of August, September and October and im like what the hell i was not told that Amber told me how much and i saved and put that money to the side, They told me she no longer work here and sorry, u should read your bill often. I was pissed and i wanted to go off but i was like okay.\\n\\n I figure if i didn't pay this it would affect my credit score so i was like okay. Contacted MAA in Memphis and still haven't heard nothing from them and very shock since i was with them in Florida, they seem very good as for as a company. i don't know whats going on here but if this apt is own by MAA but not even on there website you know something is wrong. Overall i would go to the left on this place, the rent is slowly moving up, just see for your self and there goal is to make the front look good comeback after the leasing office leaves you will see what im taking about.....", "I bought a Fry Daddy at the Corningware Outlet. That was the highlight of my visit.", "I have tasted better\\\"\" all you can eat sushi\\\"\" . The fish \\nDidnt look fresh at all ... The rolls were overly done with rice\\nAnd just didnt taste good . Not a great experience overall .", "The hostess had absolutely no warmth.  The waiter seemed bored.  He deliverd the introduction like a robot.  The food was tasty but very small portions.  The street taco plate that we're supposed to share had 3 little tacos.  Really?  You can't give us one more taco shell?  The beef chow main had 3 small slices of beef and small slice of baby bok choy.  $31 plus tax and tip later, we left to get dinner elsewhere.  Not worth the money and not worth the hype of the T.V. show.", "I've stayed at the Cosmo a couple times since they opened - both great experiences! However, this past stay over Super Bowl weekend was an absolute disappointment! \\n\\nCheck-in was very easy and pleasant. I gave the gentleman at the front desk the  name of a person that will be staying in the room (arriving later in the evening) - no problems. \\n\\nWe arrived at the room only to be immediately greeted by a pungent smell of smoke. I called and spoke to a manager about it.  Instead of moving us to another room, he asked me to provide him with a convenient time for his staff to bring in an \\\"\"ozone machine\\\"\" to deodorize the space. I was speechless.\\n\\nI then go to use the bathroom, only to realize that we had NO trash cans in the ENTIRE room.  I called again. They assured me that someone was on their way to deliver new cans. We went out to grab food and gamble (2-3 hours). Arrived back - still no trash cans. Again, I called the front desk, they assured me they were on their way. 30 min later there was a knock on my door. \\n\\nWe then head out to dinner. Our friend arrives at the hotel while we are out. He gives the front desk both his and my name. They give him the room key - no problems there. He then gets to the room, unpacks, showers, shaves, grabs a drink from the mini bar and takes off to meet us at the casino. Long story short...About 2 hrs later we figure out that the front desk had given him the wrong room key (directed him to the wrong room). All this time he was showering and settling in to a room that wasn't his - luckily the owners of the room hadn't returned since he had arrived. We immediately went to speak to the front desk about this - they lightheartedly apologized (as if it was funny). Not the reaction I was expecting. They brought over another gentleman who claimed to be a \\\"\"manager,\\\"\" all he did was briefly apologize. He did not seem too interested in making sure we were satisfied. \\n\\nbtw...all of this happened on my girlfriend's bday weekend. \\n\\nI expected much more from this hotel. Its as if my business didn't matter to them. Most likely won't go back in the near future.", "My daughter ordered garlic parmesan boneless wings and received original tame. As this was a to go order she didn't go back to get this rectified.  Way too much money for the wrong stuff!", "Went to the McClintock and Southern location and saw the new change. I'm sorry to say that it's horrible. Sweet Tomatoes has always been my favorite restaurant, and now I'm sad to say that I'll probably never be back. I loved building my salad and then getting up to sample soups and mac n cheese and what not. Now you can't do that. Also, the card swiping thing is EXTREMELY tedious and extremely irritating. It's annoying to have to wait in more than one line just to get your meal. And the metal tray with the metal bowls gets very heavy to carry. My grandmother couldn't even carry hers and push her walker at the same time. I'm so disappointed in this, and even more disappointed to hear that all of the Arizona locations will be changing into this. It's not worth my money or time. And other people sitting around us were just as upset.", "Bordering near 3 stars.\\n\\nI had to wait like 6 years to finally eat at The Buffet at the Wynn!  And, wow, I ended up not being as enamored as I thought I would be.  I think I was spoiled a bit from other buffets.  Although maybe in their defense I didn't see the entire picture because we only went for lunch.  Maybe all the stops are pulled out for dinner?  I dunno.\\n\\nIt was a lovely afternoon with the wifey and after the HELL that is parking on any Strip property, we were on our way to The Buffet.  Line was already sort of long, we waited about 25 minutes before paying to go in.  After being seated, it was off to the races!  I was too excited to wait for a drink order.  \\n\\nWe approached the buffet line with a small crowd.  After the dust settled, what do I see?  A typical looking buffet?  Nah, can't be!  But overall, I was just not impressed!  What happened?  All the glowing reviews?  The heaps of praise?  I think my visit to Wynn's The Buffet came a bit too late, I really should have came when they first opened.  It just seemed so....average.\\n\\nThere were glimpses of good things at The Buffet, but that's all it was.  Many of the items available for lunch would probably be par for the course at other buffets in town.  Cheeseburger sliders?  Check.  But the ones at Golden Corral are just as good, if not actually bigger.  Rotisserie chicken?  Check.  Come on.  Costco's in my opinion is good too.  Pizza?  Check.  Need I go on?\\n\\nI tried to pick things that I wouldn't be able to enjoy at other eateries, or things not typically available on a buffet line.  But a lot of it seemed BLAH.  I did enjoy the small charcuterie section of The Buffet - a number of cured meats, nice cheeses, crackers and breadsticks for sampling.  The whole ground mustard was delicious.  But really, mustard?  One cannot get full on that alone.  If I was in a tapas place or something with a cold one, charcuterie would be ideal.\\n\\nTrying to make a plate was a bit of a challenge.  So many of the things were just TOO familiar.  I was expecting more.  The salad section was pretty but nothing stood out for me to try.  The congee section was a nice touch, and actually looked cool.  But the wifey loves congee in almost any form, and she said the one here at The Buffet was bland, not much taste by itself.  The condiments on top didn't really save it.  She said the congee at the Rio Carnival Buffet was better!\\n\\nI'm a little upset on Wynn's Asian section of the buffet.  So.  Damn.  Disappointing.  Mr. Wynn, you have one of the largest stakes of casino property in Macau...how can you ignore us Asians here in the states?  Your people should know that Asians visit the Wynn constantly!  Your Asian section is not up to standards!  So little choices, and bad ones at that!  Yes, that day at the buffet there were a TON of Asian folks eating, and yes, they all congregated at the Asian section.  The Asian sections of other top buffets in town are much larger, with better quality selections.  The dumplings?  Tasted store bought.  The hand rolls offered?  Soggy and too spicy.  The sushi?  Very, very mediocre.  It's like the person making them didn't know what they were doing or didn't care.  Rice was starting to dry out.  Why try making Hawaiian Poke if it's not made right?  The portion was miniscule in individual dishes, and the flavor profile was way off.  I should know, I'm from Hawaii!\\n\\nI had to stick with the other sections of the buffet to get something to eat.  There were a few gems, the meatloaf with the pearl onions being one of them.  Can you imagine that, meatloaf the highlight??  It blew my mind too.  But sadly, this is how it was for me.  I was expecting much better, and just didn't get that.\\n\\nI heard at the buffet at the Wynn they have their own dessert ROOM.  Ooh, an entire room!  But again, we were severely disappointed.  Where are the fancy desserts?  I saw the candy apples but I also saw some kid who looked like he was about to break a tooth on them.  So I skipped that.  The gelato wasn't anything special, we can now find that at the local Station Casino buffet.  A lot of desserts didn't look appetizing or worth the calories.  It really all looked like mini desserts brought in from another local bakery that supplies other restaurants.  Left the dessert ROOM very sad.\\n\\nThe service was downright lackluster.  Our server was only present at the beginning to take our drink order.  The entire meal we didn't get refills until near the end.  Totally irritating, especially since all we ordered was water and iced tea.\\n\\nFor the price of $25.99 for lunch I felt a bit ripped off.  Really, I think it's overpriced for what you are getting.  The lunch at the Bellagio buffet is less and I think offers better choices.  At Wynn you pay for the ambience more than anything because it is a nice space with lots of sunlight.  I'll visit again someday (maybe in another 6 years) but next time will consider dinner instead in hopes of there being a more varied food menu.", "I stayed at Harrah's from Wed., Aug. 28 and checked out Sat. morning, Aug 31.  I got to Harrah's about 1:30 p.m. and waited approximately 30-40 minutes in line waiting to check in.  There were approximately 45-50 people in line, and to say that the line moved at a snail's pace is a gross understatement.  I looked at the check-in counter, and to my surprise, there are 13 - yes, that's right, THIRTEEN - computer monitors set up.  And how many of those computers actually had a reservation clerk sitting at them?  While I was in line, there were four clerks helping with check-in.  Then it went down to three, and eventually two clerks!  Seriously??  Only TWO clerks to help 40-50 people in line at a registration desk that seats THIRTEEN clerks ???  After reading some of the other comments on this site, I see that the check-in process has been complained about numerous times.  Harrah's, please wake up!  You're not making any friends with such poor and slow service at check-in.  \\n\\nI stayed in the Carnival Tower, Room 1435.  While the room was neat and clean, it's rather dated.  The carpeting looked old and somewhat dirty.  Same for the drapes/curtains on the window - they really need to be replaced.  The towels in the bathroom - they were clean; however, some were SO old they actually had holes in them!  Really?  Is this any way to impress your guests? Call me crazy, but when my towels get holes in them, I throw them out and get new ones.  Someone at Harrah's needs to do an inventory on the linens and get rid of the holey towels!  \\n\\nCall me picky, but I notice just about everything in a hotel room.  The tissue holder on the vanity in the bathroom looked like it has been there since shortly after World War II!  A very hideous gold color; the holder itself was chipped in several places; and the tissues were so rough I didn't use them.  Come on, Harrah's, let's get a little classier, OK?  \\n\\nDuring my stay, I only ate at one of the restaurants, that being the 24 hour caf\\u00e9.  The food was so-so.  The menu is rather limited and I thought it a little expensive for what was offered.  \\n\\nI also signed up for Harrah's Reward Program.  That also involved standing in line for about 20 minutes as there were only TWO clerks to help out.  What's with the lack of help at these desks?  I don't come to Vegas to wait in lines!  Finally a clerk who was helping at the Platinum Desk was kind enough to help out so the line moved a little faster.  Management is in DIRE need of learning how to staff the registration desk and the Rewards area with more than just two people!!  This is part of \\\"\"customer service\\\"\" and it's one of several things that will make a person decide if he/she will stay at this property in the future.  \\n\\nThe one really nice thing about Harrah's is it's location.  Located Center Strip, you are really close to many things.  However, that's about the only positive it has going for it.  Based on my experience with slow service, both at the registration desk and the Rewards line, I'm not sure I'd stay here again.  I give it a 2.5 rating overall.", "So, this was the first stop (Saturday brunch) in the 24-hour glutton-fest known as Harrah's Buffet of Buffets.  Unfortunately, instead of starting off with a bang, it was more like a fizzle.\\n\\nI hadn't been to Caesar's Palace since I was a kid, so the whole hotel area was pretty much a new experience to me.  After parking, we basically traversed the entire casino floor to reach the Lago buffet.  Expecting an extremely long line, I was pleasantly surprised to only find a pretty long line.  However, the line did move quickly and it probably only took 45 minutes to get through to the cashier.\\n\\nAfter some seating confusion, my group of 10 was split up into two groups of 5.  Which was fine, since we avoided the 18% gratuity charge tacked on for groups of 8 or more.  What wasn't fine was the cashier openly complaining about how my friends paid individually (instead of the entire group on one bill).  \\n\\nThe food, was, well, okay.  Nothing too special, nothing extraordinary popped out in my mind.  It didn't stop me from stuffing my face with two plates and a plate of desserts, but overall it was meh.  I had an iced tea, but a couple of my friends said their sodas were flat.\\n\\nThe dessert station had two desserts that I particularly enjoyed.  The first was this coffee (mocha?) pudding with a chocolate coffee bean on top.  The second was a raspberry pudding cup with you guessed it, a raspberry on top.\\n\\nAll in all, if you're staying at the Caesar's already, then it's not a horrible choice to go to.  However, if you feel up to driving or walking, definitely try another on the list of Buffet of Buffets.", "Orzo meatballs are good. Had the spaghetti with lemon and shrimp, delicious. My husband ordered the pasta fagoli. We both didn't care for it. He had the vegetable rigatoni, I liked it but he didn't. We didnt care for the olive oil bread.

Had a 12 party reservation at 10:30pm. The mngr Eric was so PO'd we were holding up the kitchen he refused to accommodate our parties' table. He said he could put 2 tables of 6  and when I said ok he told me to \\\"\"get back to my table.\\\"\" Never did fix the tables he was just an ass about it. So rude and unappreciative of the fact we were about to spend $1000 at his shitty casino restaurant. I will never ever come to this restaurant again. If they didn't want to have a party of 12 come in at 10:30pm then they shouldn't have made the reservation!!", "Tried this car wash a couple times a year ago and was not happy with their service.  Today I decided to give them another try.  I got the highest level car wash which was $34.99.  I was reminded why I stopped going here and why I will never go back.  After completing the car and upon my inspection I discovered they didn't even vacuum the rear interior or bother to wipe the seats.  The manager was apologetic and had it redone.  I drove away without re-inspecting but looked at the back interior when I got a block away and was amazed they still hadn't  wiped the interior.  There was still dirt all over the seat trim.  I took the car back and they lazily whipped it down.  Still marginally clean I left in frustration and will never return.  I've talked to a few people today who say they've tried this car wash and were disappointed.  Don't waste your money or time here.", "I went Big Earl's for the first time with a friend around 8pm recently.  There was one guy eating at the bar and another guy sitting at the bar just watching football on the TV.  We waited a couple minutes and we're greeted by no one.  We approached the men sitting at the bar and the man eating said he didn't work there. The other guy didn't get off the chair and asked if we wanted to eat. He then tells us to sit wherever we'd like and continues to watch some more football before bringing any menus over.  After he drops off a couple menus during the commercial break he heads to behind the bar where he shouts across the room asking us if we want anything to drink.  This poor service continued on for the remainder of our stay.   When our food came to the table one of the dishes was chile rellano when I ordered the ribs.  We were the only people in the restaurant so I'm not sure how that order got messed up. By the time the ribs came out my friend had already ate 75% of his meal.  No apology was given or any attempt to make sure we were fully satisfied.  At one point during our visit the server/cook (aka, guy who was more interested in watching football) brought over a mystery sauce in a bowl that he starting spooning onto both of our plates without asking.\\n\\nOverall, I would never return to this place again and highly recommend anyone considering going to Big Earl's to stay away and pick another place.", "This was quick and convenient.  And..... it was quick and convenient.\\n\\nI ordered their fish taco plate and ended up biting into what tasted like a salt taco!  Yuck!  I thought it was just one spot on the fish, but my second taco was just as salty.\\n\\nMy friend had a chicken quesadilla that was equally unpleasant.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the \\\"\"serve yourself\\\"\" chips and salsa could not make up for our disappointing entrees.  :(", "Nothing wrong with this restaurant but nothing amazing either. It's in a key location for festival frivolities so ideal for a quick fill if you are crowd dodging. Portion sizes are adequate and the Saag chicken as described in the menu. The August squeeze is on in here with tables close together and the spiced heat from the kitchen never too far away. Pappadoms were half forced into our menu before a curry choice had been made, however an array of four pickles to go with, were half worth the \\u00a32 charged for them. Sparkling water was dear, as was most of the drinks menu. For answering the 'where can we get a curry around here?' question, Saffrani will be a quick fix, a stones throw away from a majority of venues.", "What a waste of money! Had the Classic Steampot, the shrimp were small and just wasn't worth the money. Service was good", "This hotel is old and janky and the friendly, helpful staff seems to know it. I felt bad for them. I can imagine they deal with a number of complaints so kudos to them for really getting that they are not the problem. \\n\\nThe entire hotel staff - front desk, house cleaning, shuttle service, restaurant - do try to make your stay pleasant. They really are the only thing this place has going for it. \\n\\nI actually had to change rooms. I have never done that before but the first room I had apparently had the \\\"\"towers\\\"\" AC right above it and it was going to run nonstop. Luckily, it wasn't an issue for me to move. \\n\\nThe hair dryer shorted out on me both mornings of my two day stay. My hair was dry enough so I was rather amused by this. I needed to print off my boarding pass. The business office is not complimentary here, but they did offer free computer use and printing for boarding passes. Great! Not so great? The fact that the network moved soooooo sssssllllloooowwww that I couldn't get to the area to actually print out the boarding pass in the allotted 15 minutes. The hotel subs out the services for the business office. Not a good idea. \\n\\nI mentioned at the front desk that I didn't have a room service menu in my room. One of the people working said that was probably because of \\\"\"renovations.\\\"\" I'm not sure what the two things have in common at this point, but it wasn't worth it to question it. \\n\\nAt one point, I was going down the elevator and ran into a woman who was delivering room service. The elevator moved really slow. She sighed and shook her head. \\n\\n\\\"\"This is an interesting hotel,\\\"\" I commented. \\n\\\"\"Oh yeah,\\\"\" she said with a laugh. \\n\\nAgain ... not a bad place. It serves its purpose.

Where to start..where to start..?\\n\\nOkay well let's make this easy and start with my favorite thing about the place, the bread. LOL it's sad how serious I am. When bringing out the water, they bring out an assortment of bread and thin crisps along with this pico de gallo sort of concoction of tomatoes, along with a side of butter. I usually hate tomatoes but that side dish was DELISH. We literally asked our server to bring more at least 4 times. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, we ordered crab cakes, which pretty much tasted like something you can find in the frozen food section of Costco. We also opted for the soup of the day which was an asparagus cream. Again, you could probably find it at Costco. Salads were typical, nothing to rave about, then again it was just a Caesar so there's not a lot you can mess up there. \\n\\nAs the main course, my parents went with the steak...very fatty but still good. I decided to be healthy and go with a fish dish. It was mediocre, that's all I could remember from it. \\n\\nI say, go with the shrimp scampi, my dad has brought it home before and it was okay, very cheesy and greasy though. It's not the food that has lead me to decrease my rating, it's the service. First of all, every table is given two servers, one being the main one who takes your order and serves you courses, and the other acts as their assistant, constantly making sure your glass is full or if you need any extra items. With this type of service, you would expect it to be a high class restaurant with AMAZING service, you're given two afterall! Our main server would walk by our table yelling out the status of our food, as he walked to the back or to another table. He did it several times, after the 3rd or 4th we realized he was actually talking to us. The assistant was great, we honestly wanted to sneak him the whole tip but felt like he might get some trouble from his buddy, so we decided to be fair. \\n\\nAs far as the overall ambiance of this 'steak house', it felt like a Golden Corral. \\n\\nOverall, this is a nice place to have dinner...if your meal is comped by the casino.", "The food and Service was disgusting. My wife and I had Chili and both of us had severe stomach problems .  I  should go to the Health Department.. I have pictures of the So called food. I spent over $30.00 FOR A CASUAL lunch and for Dog food? Are you kidding? I had one bite of each item and left it . I want a refund . I was there about 3:30 pm 1/11 .

No wonder it is empty in here now.", "As a Pittsburgh transplant, the fascination with Primanti's always seemed a little ridiculous. The sandwiches are okay, but they're hardly good enough to overcompensate for their lack of quality service, and pure arrogance that I've experienced from their staff.\\n\\nThis particular location is the perfect example of how Primanti's thinks that living on \\\"\"Pittsburgh legend\\\"\" status is enough. Why should they provide decent service when your seat will just be replaced by some other fool looking for a sub-par meal because it's \\\"\"famous?\\\"\"\\n\\nWe only agreed to meet our friends at Primanti's because they advertise that they have NFL Sunday Ticket and we assumed that they'd actually show a variety of games...you know like every other bar that pays for the service. With our group made up of two Steelers fans, one Ravens fan, and one Eagles fan, we were hoping to be able to watch all of the games, but despite this location having a ridiculous abundance of televisions, we were denied the ability to watch the Eagles/Giants or Ravens/Bengals games. We were told that the Steelers would be on all of the televisions, and one TV at the bar would be turned to RedZone, and that since RedZone shows highlights of all of the games, that should suffice. This was coming from the manager, nonetheless! Thanks, man...thanks for not even trying to help your customers out. God forbid, not every one of your customers cares about the local team. Especially at a touristy spot. We saw 3 Ravens fans, and a Texans fan...all roaming around trying to find a TV with their games on. But, hey, they can't possibly change the channel on one of their 50 TV's.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I look across the bar and we realize that one TV was turned to the Falcons game for ONE fan in a corner booth. Another TV actually had the Giants/Eagles game on it, but that, too, was in a corner booth and the only person who seemed to be watching it was our friend...who was forced to squint to watch from across the bar.\\n\\nSo, in the end, the manager and bartender both contradicted their \\\"\"policy\\\"\" of only showing the Steelers game. Too bad we couldn't get any reasoning for their decision.\\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough, the service at the bar was laughable. The bartender acted like customers were bothering her when we wanted a drink or to order food. She didn't get our order right, either. So to round off a horrible experience, we didn't get to watch our games AND we didn't get what we ordered, despite being charged for the things they didn't bring out. No apologies, no positive customer service, and nothing but arrogance coming from both the manager and the bartender.\\n\\nIt's a good thing their name will keep the money rolling in, because any other restaurant would be out of business with Primanti's level of service. We definitely won't be back.", "1/2 cuz the room had a fridge...\\n\\nlol..we check in, they give us directions to our room, its not in the same building, they send us back to our car, then we had to drive to the \\\"\"Manor\\\"\" rooms, theyre these shitty rooms that are NOT connected to the casino, 5 minute walk.... in 3 story buildings that look like motel 6's, but MORE ghetto\\n\\n5 stars for kids tho!!! , most amazing arcade ive ever seen, if i were still a kid, i would have gone nuts!! however..im not a kid anymore : /\\n\\nstayed with family on this last trip, wow, never do that again, i would much rather pay double,triple, or quad for any other 3, 4 star hotel in vegas", "Brought my dog to Horizon because a friend recommended them.

It is always recommended to go 2.3 cm and he went 1.2 cm so he left cancer according to lab reports. He refused to redo the surgery to get the rest. He was very negative and rude insinuating that my dog would probably die in 2 years anyway. Got a second and third opinion and was told my boxer had an excellent prognosis. Another doctor is fixing what he did this morning. The first surgery was $400 a waste of money and pain my dog was put through. Now another $700 to redo the surgery.

My experience: the one bus--not two as promised, the second cancelled by the owner of the company because of his own mistake only a couple hours before the event--showed up massively late.  Of course, we booked two because we had too many people for one, so the driver had to take two trips.  I was on the second trip, which made it only a minute before the beginning of the ceremony.\\n\\nIn addition, I heard the owner was extremely rude and unprofessional, and hung up on the person who booked the service multiple times.

I hope whoever wins Hell's Kitchen hasn't taken over as executive chef of this place yet because that would mean that Ramsay made a bad choice. If what we experienced happened during dinner service on that show, someone would have been kicked out of the kitchen. \\n\\nMy boyfriend tried to order a beer, but we were told they were out of it and the server couldn't really recommend a comparable choice. So he gave us what felt like 15 minutes to choose another beer and then came back for our order. \\n\\nI ordered the chopped salad, Leo got the Shepard's pie and we share the pub chips. Everything was just OK. The chopped salad mentioned wood-grilled chicken, but what I got resembled shredded rotisserie chicken - pretty bland.

And watched our server schmooze with a larger party for 10 minutes before we could flag him down and ask again. Once we got the menu and picked out a dessert (Sticky Toffee Pudding, which was actually very good), we had to wait until another server tapped ours on the back to let him know we were waiting. \\n\\nBy the time we finished everything, nearly two hours had passed and the place was pretty much dead.

An hour later, at 8:15 we finally revived our salads. Finally at about 9:00 we had had enough, after over an hour and a half of waiting for our meal while everyone else around us was being seated, served, and eating.

When I tried to resend I called the shop getting the same guy that helped me.  He then put me a hold for awhile then came back forgetting he had me on hold.

I swear they were created or bought by chiropractors trying to make money from all the sore necks that they'll have to treat. I have a tempurpedic bed and a tempurpedic pillow at home, but I don't mind using down pillows or whatever else. I've been to my fair share of hotels and never had a complaint about a pillow until now. That's how bad these pillows are. I ended up using the couch cushion with a towel over it. I'm a complete germaphobe and hate touching hotel things, but I had to resort to the couch cushion. Hopefully, no one had sex on it. It is Tuesday, my stay ended Sunday. My neck is still sore.\\n\\nAnyways, on to the customer service aspect. \\n\\nMLife and Delano need to get their sh*t together. I booked using MLife and received a small discount.  I think I save $100? The total for 2 nights was $480. Anyways, they refused to let me add anyone else to the room because of this discount.

I was boarding when she told me the news, so she still ended up waiting but seriously, get it together. \\n\\nWe called to request late check out and they said that we could only request it the same day. This is not a policy I've noticed at any other hotel I've been to, but fine. I go down at 12:15AM coming back from a show. The check in/out clerk tells me that I have to request it in the morning. So not same day, it has to be in the morning. Seriously, Delano, I don't pay extra to stay at a nicer hotel to deal with such crappy service. I wanted to sleep in, because I've been getting such lousy sleep from their lousy pillows. The front desk guy told me that he'll send up pillows. They never came.\\n\\nThe day of check out. I finally fall asleep using the couch pillows and the door bell rings at 9AM. It's housekeeping. They want to clean the room, that I'll be checking out of in a few hours...

If I ever go to Miami, I will stay away from Delano. \\n\\nI don't know what your plan on coming to Vegas was, but if it was to expand your brand recognition, it may have worked, but my perception of Delano is negative.

I still think the concept is great, however thought in the execution seems to have been absent.\\n\\nWe showed up at 9:20pm for a 9:45pm show. We waited outside the ropes for about 10 minutes until we'd be allowed into our theater. This gave a a few minutes to look around. The theater is linked to both the Salt Lounge and Tanzy Restaurant with coordinated decor making for a very stunning and appealing sight with a comfy feel. We had just came from dinner at Tanzy's (separate review). We ordered the Gold package and were told our server would take care of everything once inside the theater.\\n\\nOnce we were allowed to enter everyone entered the same door. It wasn't until we were trapped in the line that we realized there was another door on the other side that would have sped up the wait to get into our seat. Maybe if they were both open that might have streamlined seating.\\n\\nwe got to our seats, got comfortable (more on that), experimented with the electric recliner and generally got situated. Once our server showed, we ordered. My wife wanted a white wine. The server highly recommended one of their Chardonnays. We learned after tasting that 1) don't take wine recommendations from someone not old enough to drink and 2) iPic doesn't know a quality wine from vinegar. The Chardonnay was easily the worst either one of us had tasted and we didn't finish it. \\n\\nWe ordered Chocolate covered strawberries and the Oreo Ice cream sandwich. Our server didn't know they were out of the ice cream sandwich and told us when she delivered the strawberries. Probably a good thing since that probably prevented another food abortion. The chocolate covered strawberries were also horrible and unripe. My bet is, they're not made on premises but charge as if they were. After just eating at Tanzy, I wrongly assumed the menu would be similar since I believe they're owned by the same. Menu was not great..at least the dessert menu with it's three options. The other option was a Berries Sabayon which the server tried to push after our two previous dessert failures. \\n\\nNot long into the movie my wife noticed her 3D glasses were dirty. It took about 30 minutes before we saw our \\\"\"server\\\"\" again to ask for another pair. The second pair was better but not much. They reuse glasses and the high school kids working there probably aren't too into cleaning them well.\\n\\nComfort. I was all set for a nice comfortable recliner. Not. There is a metal bar running across the middle of the back of the recliner that will be guaranteed to let you know it's there by the middle of the movie. I spent the second half of the movie trying to avoid the bar to no success. The only way I was able to minimize the bar in the back was with the foot rest down which kind of defeats the point of a recliner. Since your feet won't touch the ground (and I'm 6'1\\\"\"), that is an uncomfortable feeling as well.\\n\\nWhile the concept is fantastic, the designers and operators really ignored the details.

We ate our meal with our coats on until we  finally asked a server if they would close the door. We were told they would TRY to keep it closed.  We wanted to have an after dinner drink and a dessert but decided not to stay because  we asked another server if they could please find our server.

There were some big groups that had come in but the service was still on par - the waitress took our order & it wasn't very long before we got it.\\n\\nI had ordered the Lat Na & my lunch companion ordered the House Pho'nomenal. The Lat Na was just some chicken, shrimp, & noodles in a sweet sauce ... Nothing flavorful. And I had ordered it at a 2 on a 1-5 scale & it came out pretty spicy. The chicken had a weird taste / smell & the shrimp wasn't much better ... It had the texture of frozen shrimp that had been overcooked. I tried a bite of the Pho & couldn't have much more than that but my companion enjoyed it.\\n\\nThe awful part was that the table was really sticky and there were soup spoons in a holder which I had to pick through 3 of them to find a clean one to use. Also, there were some patrons at a table just next to us who asked to move b/c there were ants all over their table. When we got to the front to pay our bill, we also saw some ants on the counter & there were 2 people who worked there standing right by them who made no effort to clean it up! Additionally, our to-go box was leaking ... Perhaps the ants had bitten through it.\\n\\nWe are definitely not going back!!", "Wouldn't eat there again.\\n\\nWe had tickets to Blue Man Group, and wanted somewhere close and reasonably priced. We made a 7:00 reservation. \\n\\nWhen we arrived at 7:00, the hostess was no where to be seen (the hour we spent there, I only saw the hostess go to the hostess stand once). We were finally seated, ordered drinks, appetizers and food.\\n\\nThe wontons were ok, nothing to write home about. The calamari was VERY good (the only positive thing I have to say). I ordered beef with broccoli, my husband the fried rice. It wasn't too long to wait for the food.\\n\\nThe beef with broccoli was not served with rice. When I asked, the waiter said rice didn't come with the dish???!!! I asked for him to bring me some.\\n\\nThe food was no better than what we get at home for the takeout place, but cost three times as much.\\n\\nSave your money. Go someplace else.", "Here we go another year later and another change in ownership, but the way they try to explain why it takes 45 minutes to serve your order is amazing.

Came to get my malshi puppy groomed for the first time and she came back nothing like we had asked! My puppy is half Maltese and shihtzu so her breeds coat is that of a shihtzu. We told the groomer that we wanted a \\\"\"teddybear cut\\\"\" and even pointed to the picture of a Maltese with the exact cut on the wall. The groomer told us that she would do that cut, however nearly 3 1/2 hours later we come back to find our puppy sloppily cut.. The groomer had shaved down all of her hair around her muzzle! That is not a teddybear cut! Any groomer should know that a teddybear cut requires you leave the length of the muzzle around and round out the face around the jaw line. She then left all her hair around the body long and cut her legs very thin at the bottom. My poor puppy looked absolutely awful. The groomers reasoning was that my puppies hair needed to grow out evenly so  \\\"\"she\\\"\" decided to shave her muzzle down. Of course my puppy had plenty of hair around her face and muzzle to be able to wear a \\\"\"teddybear cut\\\"\" .. I was livid. I ended up buying my own pet clipper set and shaved her down more evenly, however her face now looks like a poodle, and now it will take months to grow back! She also had knicks from the clipper on her stomach, and long patches of hair randomly around her mouth. Absolutely ridiculous ! I will never have my dog groomed there again!!!", "Yesterday I stopped in for a drink after a long morning of Christmas shopping and wasn't really sure what to order so I asked the barista for a recommendation (no one was behind me in line so I didn't think it was a big deal).

Sadly, we didn't.\\n\\nOn our first visit we got the White Chocolate Frozen Hot Chocolate to share which was good, but not worth the $11 price tag. Next we each got BBQ & Blue Burger which was flavorless and had insufficient BBQ sauce on it. This visit receives 2 stars.\\n\\nOn our second visit (we were drunk) we got the All In Nachos and Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza. The nachos look delicious, but they taste so-so. I was really bummed that they just put melted cheese on the nachos instead of using nacho cheese (cheese whiz). Also, the chips underneath the top layer were pretty much missing all of the \\\"\"All In\\\"\" toppings so we were just eating plain chips. Thankfully, the Margherita Pizza was good so kicked the nachos to the side and feasted on the pizza.

Their online ordering and REWARD program is unparalleled (I belong to  every chains reward and email clubs, they are all pathetic. Not PJ's! Join and find out!) \\n\\n* My local PJ is a franchise that in my opinion is a model for any franchise of any type. They know us by face and by name and greet us so when we come in. The food is well prepared and consistent. They service is fast and extra friendly. They rarely screw-up; and IF they do they are apologetic and fast to fix it in a method that we prefer.\\n\\nSo... What about THIS LOCATION??\\n\\nWe were having a family gathering in Phoenix and someone said \\\"\"Let's get pizza! We'll have Domino's deliver!\\\"\"\\n\\n\\\"\"Wait!\\\"\" I said.

Um, I didn't appreciate getting that lecture. I went to Macy's looking to buy a nice present for my husband - and I thought a watch would be perfect, and it looked stylish, too. So sue me! The watch works fine, and still works and even better than other watches we have here at home that are made by \\\"\"watch making\\\"\" companies.\\n\\nAnd speaking of fine \\\"\"watch making\\\"\" companies, I needed a new wristband for my Skagen watch. The watch was designed in a way to look stylish, but it actually was a design flaw that made a weak point for the writstband, which had worn through. I took it in to Dykman's to get a new writstband, and OK - I happen to love colors and because I love colors other than boring black or brown, I wanted a red wristband. Apparently, that was asking for too much and apparently to Dykman's, grownups don't wear colorful wristbands. My only choice was a black wristband - so a black wristband I got. I was told that was all Skagen had to offer as it had to be ordered from Skagen (that's how special the watch was), but I'm suspicious about that.\\n\\nThen, during the former occasion, I took in my \\\"\"Nine West\\\"\" watch - the scandal of it all! This time, it wasn't a Skagen - so I knew I could safely ask for a red wristband. I did get a red wristband - but later, when I got some time to think about it and examine it more, I think I got a child's wristband. I mean really! Is it so hard to have a variety of adult wristbands to choose from? Is it too much to ask for something other than black, or brown?\\n\\nThe last straw was when I got a battery put in the Nine West watch after the above lecture on the inferior quality of timepieces made by companies that don't specialize in making watches and clocks - and suddenly, the battery didn't last very long at all. At first, I thought - darn fashion company for making an inferior watch - but then I went to get a new battery put in just to see and funny thing, it kept on ticking and still works to this day (although maybe there was a slight point in the lecture, as the hands are a little bit off, but it still works. I cannot even tell you where my Skagen watch is, as the stupid design flaw has rendered that watch unwearable and missing in action to this day.)", "The pizza here is just so-so.  They claim to have excellent New York style pizza that rivals the East coast, but they fall far far FAR short of that mark.  We tried the carne and the meatball.  Both were alright.

This is where I will part with the positive.\\n\\n I ordered along with my daughter the pulled pork sandwich. Half of which (i'm kicking myself for the lack of picture) was fat. Not fat and lots of meat but straight up disgusting slimy fat that I had to pick out. Gross! The bun was mushy and so was half of the salvaged meat. The texture was terrible. I added 2 ribs for $2.99 and they were not even worth commenting on. My husband wanted to eat the rest of them and I was more then happy to share the ribs with out the warning.

Great, thats what a lunch special usualy includes...small orders of a few different items.  Nope, when i called back to order this special, i was told I was to choose one of the 3, not that i get all 3.  So I ordered the Blissful Fried Rice. When I went in to pick it up, it was ready and thats always a plus to not have to wait on an order that was called in 20 minutes prior.  I then ordered a Mumbai Spirit, or hot chai, and my total came to $10, and I left $1 tip.  When the cashier made my drink she poured a pre-made chai mix into a steaming pot, steamed it for a solid 4 seconds and poured it into what looked like it should be a childs cup, or water cup at any other place.  When she handed me the drink it felt like there was nothing in the cup but foam, and the paper it was made out of.  I opened it up to find that my childs size cup was only filled half way, and i asked her if I could have her fill the cup as I paid $3 for this drink. She told me thats how much you get if you eat in, therefor thats how much i get it if i take it to go.\\n\\nSo to round out my LAST experience at The Loving Hut, I paid $6 for a small container of rice with some bits of carrots, peas, tofu, and cilantro. I would say this order cost them a solid $0.75 to make, and my pre-made 3 1/2 sips of chai that was steamed to a foamy perfection, was maybe $0.40 because of the waste of paper cup.\\n\\n I REALLY wanted to be able to love this place and eat here often, as there are next to no vegetarian or vegan places around, but for the price I will happily go somewhere else like Mellow Mushroom, who have a few tofu, tempeh, and veggie items, and be able to pay the same prices for food that is delicous.", "We had a late Sunday breakfast here (08/17/14).

This last visit was a follow up to a hospital stay for my mom and I brought all the info the hospital gave me which included all the meds she was on and was put on during her stay. Dr. Suni did not address one of the meds, so  I called on June 30th and still never heard anything as of this morning and it is now the 7th of July. After a 25 min hold time and not wanting to leave another message to go un answered, I did the long hold wait and  finally got a person to talk with.. She proceeded to tell me that a script was called in on the 3rd, but no one bothered to call me to let me know it was taken care of. I never received a call from the pharmacy either, which would have been a sign that it had been taken care of. So I was told it was faxed over and again they apologized for the bad follow up again. I personally think they take too many patients for the amount of rooms and doctors they have available. I know no one likes to get sick and go to the doctors, but when you do this office is not one that I love to go to and I personally would never be a patient here. Unfortunately  with my mom's age and health issues, to start over with someone else and having to rely on them sending complete records to another doctor in hope it gets done correctly is two fold, as I feel anyway I turn it is going to be a mess.

You see it touted on some websites as one of the best in Las Vegas deals.  I think it is a decent belly stuffer but not a great deal for most people.  It is probably very popular because they keep A-1 steak sauce on the table unlike most places where you have to ask for it.\\n\\nThis is the $10.95 16 oz. T-bone.  The salad is decent size and they put a lot of blue cheese dressing on the salad which included olives, a few slices of cucumbers and tomato.  The quality of the blue cheese dressing was pretty good with visible chunks of blue cheese.\\n\\nThe steak was accompanied by 3 potato halves, 2 onion rings, 1 halved Texas Toast, a miller or bud (I forgot which one) baked beans and a lettuce garnish.\\n\\nBaked beans were okay--probably Heinz out of a can.  The 2 onion rings were more like garnish than a true side but actually pretty good-- one of the better onion rings.  The potatoes tasted like they were lightly fried with a crispy top but they could have been baked.  There was a slight fishy flavor but under the crust they tasted okay.\\n\\nThe big disappointment was the steak. It is fairly thin, about 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick which means that it is difficult to get a medium rare type of consistency through it all.  Also, it had a fair amount of gristle.  \\n\\nI remember the last time I ate there I was pleasantly surprised by the value for the meal.  However, I've read that because steak prices have been going up that places are substituting Choice for Prime and even Select for Choice.  I think that Gold Coast may have done that here.\\n\\nYou still get enough to eat because the toast is thick, the salad large and you have baked beans but they are all fillers.  The star of a steak dinner is the steak and I think it is worse than I remember.  If you want to fill up this is still a great deal.  If you have eaten here before when it was better, you may want to reconsider.", "Extremely unhappy with the food I got here. Spend your money elsewhere!!

We paid 88ish total for the two of us. It's definitely hard to get your moneys worth here unless your fine eating crappy tasting food. \\n\\nFOOD:\\nThe two most expensive things here are probably the crab legs and the prime rib. I don't really eat much cooked seafood, so I didn't eat the crab. I love steak, so I loaded up on the PRIME RIB. Unfortunately, it tasted like DOG FOOD. That spoiled my appetite and I couldn't eat much more. \\n\\nThe rest of the food offered was super cheap stuff like hometown buffet-esque. I had some cheap chicken wings, pasta, etc. Everything tasted very subpar. \\n\\nThe gelato used to be pretty good, but I think they get it from somewhere else now. It's much worse than before. It tasted very cheap and low quality and the texture was kind of melty. I had some lemon meringue and orange white chocolate cake that was pretty decent, but thats the only thing I semi-enjoyed. \\n\\nOverall, I DO NOT RECOMMEND Wicked Spoon. Service isn't very attentive either. SERIOUSLY take your money to a nice restaurant and get yourself a high quality or steak or something.

We visit Las Vegas frequently and consider ourselves \\\"\"resort explorers.\\\"\" We like to stay at all the new or remodeled hotels in hopes of finding the ultimate Las Vegas experience. \\n\\nI am giving this hotel 2 generous stars because the room is pretty comfortable and retro looking. The Spread deli was great, probably the highlight of my stay. Good food and the best service I encountered at the Downtown Grand. Unfortunately, I have a laundry list of complaints to go along with this review.\\n\\n1. Parking structure not attached to the hotel. \\n2. Elevator out of order in the parking structure. Had to take the urine flooded stairwell with luggage in hand. \\n3. Must validate parking everytime you leave the structure. You would think a remodeled resort would have keycard access to parking.\\n4. No fans in bathrooms. \\n5. Bathroom very bland.\\n6. Customer experience is subpar.\\n7. Was given directions to the wrong tower.\\n8. Valet attendant yelled at me for not having a validated parking slip! Really?!!! I am a guest! I am paying to be here \\n\\nMorning add-on:\\nSlept well, bed is comfortable. However, the room does not have an iron standard and it has to be delivered upon request. Secondly, there is no where to put soap or other toiletries while showing. I had to place my stuff on the ground in the shower. The shower also only has one door which leaves a wet slippery mess on the floor and quite the \\\"\"drafty\\\"\" cold showering experience.\\n\\nWhen leaving the parking structure I inserted my validated parking pass and I was asked to pay 9 dollars! Are you kidding? I am a guest! I had to get very insistent with the crew on the \\\"\"assistance\\\"\" phone line to get let out of the garage! \\n\\nThis visit was awful, almost like a nightmare I couldnt escape. In closing, I think the Downtown Grand needs to reevalute ways to Wow their clients and make their processes more efficient. I recommend valet parking for all and no self parking. Also a paperless system for parking and revisit room ammenities. It wouldnt hurt to liven up the casino with music and other attractions. It is a littlw unclear what the hotel theme is.

DO NOT GO HERE.\\n\\nMy family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said \\\"\"sure...\\\"\" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.\\n\\nAs we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.  Great. \\n\\nThe rest of my family later came back from the restroom (akin to going to a restroom at a grocery store where you're around stock items...except you need to go through their kitchen). They started with salad. The waiter asked if I wanted anchovies or something else on my salad. I was going to say \\\"\"sure\\\"\" but my wife stopped me and said it could be extra. The waiter, looking like he got caught, verified he was offering all extras to me even though earlier the owner said salads came with dinner. I had to say,\\\"\"I just want the standard salad, nothing extra.\\\"\" I couldn't let my guard down.\\n\\nWe ordered some food, priced about what you'd expect.  The pita and hummus I ordered earlier was just barely average so I don't know why they thought it was worth $4. My sister ordered \\\"\"leg of lamb\\\"\" so I expected to see a leg of a lamb. Instead when her plate came out, it looked like sad slices of ham. Really. We all got vegetables but they were soggy and unappetizing. I saw them earlier in the kitchen sitting in a big pot when I had used the restroom. Nothing here is fresh. My lamb was on the chewy side. My sister's \\\"\"leg of lamb\\\"\" was left uneaten and she asked if I wanted some. I \\\"\"tried\\\"\" to eat it but it was too chewy. They then asked for dessert. I wanted to say no out of my discontent but again my family members all said yes, even when they were telling me the food was not great.  I don't have their sense of pity. The desert and salad were the best things of the night, which was kind of sad. \\n\\nWhen we got the receipt and my wife insisted we check it.  Surprise. They overcharged us $7 from two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list what you ordered. I went up the the cashier to ask them what the two items were. He tried to explain one but he really couldn't. He scratched out the $3 item. I then questioned the $4 charge. Again he tried to explain it but he really couldn't. Again he agreed with me and scratched out the $4.  On top of all this we still gave them a normal tip out of pity. I could tell the waiters were just following orders. I could tell the owner had trained them what to say and how to make extra money.\\n\\nYou've been warned. There's a reason why this place is doing so poorly.  There's a reason why the whole hour between 7:30pm and 8:30pm we were the only ones in the restaurant. There's a reason why the owner is begging customer to come in. They're cutting corners on customer service and food quality in exchange for salesman tactics, overcharging and tricking you to buy things you don't even know is extra. DO NOT GO HERE.\\n\\nOwners like this will say,\\\"\"But I have to or else I won't make it.\\\"\" You know what? Restaurants like yours shouldn't make it. Not to be harsh but it was a poor experience. Change your food, your sales tactics and your fake receipt items strategy.

I don't know if we just had a one time bad experience, but the food was not very good.  We ordered some Pho and the broth was not up to standard and the ingredients were mediocre at best....and the veggies were very sparse.  Just some basil and a handful of beansprouts.  The egg rolls seemed as though they were old and warmed over leftovers.  You could definitely tell that they were not fresh.  And my wife's crepe was super greasy and inedible!

The weights are always all over the place and even though the trainers have designated weights for themselves in their \\\"\"special\\\"\" corner they tend to steal all the weights from the rack. There are dirty paper towels every where and theres no one going around to pick them up. Whoever put the mirrors in the building was an idiot because they are so incorrectly placed that majority of the time you cannot see yourself. Ive gone there 5 times a week for a year, and the staff half the time says hi to me or their too busy conversing with each other or eating. I do not know who the main manager is, you would think since Ive been going there so long, they would have the decency to know their members. I've tried a few of their yoga classes and they were so bad that half the class left 30 minutes into it. One class I went too the whole time we were doing warrior poses and that was it... I know gym yoga isnt the best but this was just flat out awful. Ive started to drive out of my way to the McCormick Ranch LA Fitness and the 7th Street/Moon Valley LA fitness because this is so bad. The reason that Ive had it with this gym though is this morning I went to go workout.. and whoever was supposed to show up at 7AM to open the gym, never showed up. It was 7:45AM when I got there and there was about 50 people waiting outside saying that this is the 3rd time this has happened. \\n\\nPS the trainers are awful I always see them staring off or just blabbing along while their clients are in the worst form about to pop out a knee or shoulder..

I was also excited to hear the cover was only $6 a person. That cheap and you can bring your own food and booze? I was ecstatic.\\n\\nThat excitement lasted all the way to us pulling up to the booth to pay our way in and discovering it is a cash only Theatre. No worries, they have an ATM inside so we park the jeep, go inside and pull out cash - so now our $6 cover just went to $10 with the ATM fees. We're still feeling pretty good (although a little irritated that it wasn't posted anywhere they don't take debit).\\n\\nWe found a spot and much to our dismay were surrounded by screaming kids twirling around glow sticks on strings.

We asked the server for some good reccomendations for sake, something special, nothing too cheap.  He pointed at the wine list and said \\\"\"there's the menu, you can look inside to see what you like.\\\"\"  We told them that the sake they had in the menu wasn't what we were looking for, the server then said \\\"\"then, what you see is what we have, nothing else.\\\"\"  Very not helpful.  Then we saw one of the GM, Chase, fortunately remembered us from before and then started helping us from then on, bringing out their best sakes from the \\\"\"inside\\\"\" cellar.

They have toro that comes in 3 different levels, something you can definitely order and taste the differences between all of them.  They have a few different fishes that you probably can't order anywhere else so the selection is very top of the line.  Of course they have other regular sashimi but the quality is always fresh, something i think is guaranteed everytime you go.

I looked over the menu and saw a build your own burger menu. Two vegan options, portobello mushrooms and a veggie patty. They also had beef, bison and another offering that I can't remember. All build your own burgers start at 7 bucks except the bison which is 9. Add ons are extra, cheese is 75 cents or a buck, veggies are 50 cents each, sauces are 50 cents, I'm sure it adds up and your burger could be 14 bucks if you go overboard. I decided on the hummus. \\n\\nI got a huge bowl, complete with carrot sticks, celery, and pita, not baked though, soft and fresh. Unfortunately, the hummus was rather unremarkable, bland, and could have been made better with some garlic, some herbs, or even a bit of salt and pepper. I looked on the bar for salt shakers, or a bottle of tabasco, but none were to be found. Which is a shame, with all the cooking shows on TV that the cooks here can't properly season a dish. \\nNext time i'll build a burger and see what happens.

Wow, we were seated on a bench next to 2 couples that were extremely loud.  The general manager, Cedric Castro, stopped and asked how our evening was going.  We shared with him the noise level around us.  By the way, there were 2 empty booths next to us that looked quiet compared to our table.

He checked on our wine and brought it to us immediately.  It was waiting at the bar to be delivered.    The waiter never checked on us after we received our food to make sure our order was correct and if we needed anything else.  He admitted he knew they did not have all the  vegetables for my entree.

We did not order a side salad. We simply would like the garnishings that she did not want to add on our burritos. My mates and myself at this point have had it with her deplorable attitude.

They didn't offer disposable flip flops and made me walk barefoot on the dirty floor to the nail dryer. After sitting at the dryer for 15-20 minutes, the employee checked my toes and said they were dry but the polish smudged by the time I walked to my car. They quickly moved to fix the smudged nails when I came back and showed them. Before repainting my nails, the employee took a small can of actual paint thinner and tipped some into the polish bottle! This time, she walked across the room and got disposable flops out of a drawer for me to wear. Another lady sprayed my toes with mink oil after my second turn under the nail dryer and I left in flops. When I went to put my shoes on 30 minutes later, the polish still smudged.

I went back 6 or so months later with these same concerns and was told that I have a skin condition and that it was not caused by the peel. However, I know that it was.

I live in Aliante and frequent this establishment often. On Christmas day, my family and I went to the casino to swipe our players club card since the casino had a holiday promotion. My elderly mother swiped her players card and received three tickets from the kiosk; one for $500 cash, one for $2,500 tab pull and one for $1,000 tab pull. The instructions on the tickets that printed out from the kiosk stated to \\\"\"see cashier to redeem\\\"\" and \\\"\"the ticket expires on December 30th, 2013\\\"\". My mother took the ticket for $500 to the cashier and cashed it in with no problems. Then she read the other two tickets for $2,500 and $1,000 and noticed that on the bottom of the tickets, she was indeed the lucky winner of both.  She proceeded back to the cashier to collect her winnings, and my mother was so elated that she had won this money that she broke out in tears at the cashier counter. The cashier called  the manager of the Rewards Center (Josh) to get authorization to pay the money out, and the manager promptly took the winning tickets from my mother and  told her that he would not honor her winning tickets due to a glitch in their system. We tried to reason with him and explain that she was issued those tickets by the casino, however he stated that \\\"\"he has the final say\\\"\" and the tickets would not be honored. He offered no apology, just a statement that she \\\"\"was already paid $500 that she was \\\"\"NOT ENTITLED TOO\\\"\" and walked away with the tickets in hand. I don't know about you, but when a casino gives you three winning tickets issued from their system, they had better honor them and absorb the mistake that their system made.

I asked when they would get a shipment, he just shrugged his shoulders and turned around.  Then I asked him if I could special order one because I was certain I wanted that gun.  He just shook his head and walked away. I then went to American Shooters and bought one. The salesman said it was his easiest sell ever as I already knew what I wanted and only held the gun for a minute before buying it.  I also ordered a obscure derringer that they didn't have in stock.  Imagine that, they ordered a gun for me since they didn't have one in stock. Makes sense.  \\nToday I went in to buy a Colt New Agent.  The salesman slide the action open directed at himself and handed the gun to me with the slide closed. I started to slide it back to open the action to ensure the chamber was empty.  The salesman groaned when I did that. I asked him permission to dry fire the gun and he said he didn't think it was necessary and not to rack the slide either. I asked if they had the dao trigger and he said that didn't exist.  According to Colt's official website it does, but what do I know? I asked about 38 special rounds as I handed him the gun and they said they had some.  He took the gun from me and just walked away.  Wiped it down, put it back in the display case and walked away. No offer to buy the weapon or the ammo. He then just started chatting with other employees. \\nIf I'm going to spend ~$1,000 on an item, I expect to not have to beg to buy it from the salesman.

Three of us order burgers medium rare with salad, the burgers looked as though they were straight from package with grill lines already on them. One of my friends picked up his burger to take a bite out of it and greased poured out of it. The Cesar dressing had to come from a bottle as the salad was definitely bag salad.

We were seated at a booth that included old crushed chips underneath the table and chunks of meat scattered on the floor.  Once our food arrived (yes, we stayed to eat...) we had to ask for utensils.  The food was bland overall, although the enchiladas were covered in a greasy pasta sauce (possibly Ragu).  Mexitalian anyone?  Upon leaving we visited the restroom, which appeared untouched by a cleaning agent for an unreasonable amount of time.  Considering we were one of only a few people in the restaurant at the time, the bathrooms should have been clean and our table certainly should have been set.", "Well, we heard this Scottsdale Classic has gone south, but I refused to believe it. So, when guest from Asia visited and wanted to do the Sanctuary, I said lets do Roaring Fork, no view but great food and service.\\n\\nWell, tonight (11/25/11) was a disaster.....they were over welmed by a table of 7, food was poor quality and everyone ate at different times.

Very odd.\\nNext trip in went like this: friend and I walked in, place not really busy, 4 \\\"\"hostesses\\\"\" standing around host station, after some debate they decide where to seat us, we literally sat there for 15 minutes without so much as a \\\"\"we'll be right with you\\\"\", attempted to get someone's attention, and then gave up and left.\\nThis franchise could be so good if they could just figure out what is so flawed with the corporate policy..... \\nDon't say I didn't warn you.", "Every time I have interacted with anyone from this store, I literally have the WORST customer service of my life.

It was packed when I went in which I can't fault them for but I couldn't understand why. I ordered a dirty chai with almond milk and, I hate to say it, but I have had better at Starbucks. The espresso wasn't roasted to my taste and the drip coffee was weak. It does have a lot of seating which may make it a good place to sit, but the prices were pretty high so sitting a while gets expensive. \\n\\nIf I find myself studying in Tempe again I will be going up the road to SOLO.

In the upstairs bathroom the fake floor tile is cracked and feels like you are going to fall thru the floor. Like Janet says, the shower door keeps falling off! There was a lot of mold/mildew in the shower.\\n\\nThe bedroom was fine, yes the bed was a little hard but it wasn't that bad. The upstairs TV was a flat screen with a working remote.\\n\\nI didn't use the jacuzzi, but I noted it was very clean.\\n\\nThe downstairs tv was a regular tube tv with a universal remote that doesn't work (STILL!).

It seems like 50% of the menu is gone, and all my old favorites are certainly gone.  \\n\\nI can't really say whats going on, but our last two visits I can say started out fair, then slipped directly in to unacceptable.  I can say i never thought it was great, but I always thought Chompies did mediocre perfectly.   \\n\\nSo I'll lay it out like this.  \\n\\nBurger, ordered medium, came out raw.  I'm not saying undercooked, I am saying the ground meat was RAW.  the cheese was melted, so I know someone put it on the grill to cook it.   Now talk about uncomfortable, we showed our server, who brought the manager (which we didn't ask for I assure you) who brought out a line cook...  What are you thinking, show him this health hazard somewhere else.  I did jokingly say I felt somewhat lucky we had Scottsdale Healthcare right next door after this one.\\nIn the same meal, we had two deli sandwiches.  All I can say was the meat was rubbery and wet.  Yes, wet.  To me it was almost like it came out of the freezer or something, sliced and put on the sandwich.  YUCK.  \\n\\nNow about the service which on my latest visit was ridiculously bad.  The waiter forgot items, didn't return to the table, and all, given the restaurant had 10 customers all together was horrendous.  (BTW, it wasn't our waiter who brought over the manager it was someone else, he was nowhere to be found)\\n  \\nNow my other recent visit, the service was stellar (at the PV Mall restaurant).  Our server was more than on, he was outstanding.  In fact, for that visit, the service was a solid 5/5... food was 1.5/5 on that one.\\n\\nAnyway, for us, we have seen our last visits to Chompies.  I should throw in our out of town Guests, stopped going back last year except for one hold out, who has finally said its over as well....   Everything changes, and if you can't even do mediocre, then there isn't much left...", "I'm at a loss for the high reviews for this place. Maybe I was there on an off day. I live within walking distance, so I wish I liked it more.\\nI had a caramel-flavored yogurt that tasted just like...sugar.

It wasn't very busy for lunchtime either - this is probably why", "I wish I could give 0 stars. This was the worst experience I've had at any restaurant ever. Me and 6 of my friends waited over an hour and a half for our food. During that hour and a half we kept reminding them and they kept assuring us our food was coming. Finally after an hour and a half, our food started slowly arriving. I ordered a red curry, vegetarian with tofu and as if my experience could not get any worse, the waitress brought red curry with chicken. I pointed this out and next I could clearly see  the waitress go to the back, scoop the chicken out and replace it with tofu and bring it back! Oh and I also ordered a tea which they never bothered to bring out. Unbelievable and completely disrespectful of our time and vegetarian choices.", "Went with a party of 8 for my friends Bachelor Party.  \\n\\nWe'll start with the good: \\n\\nHad the Pittsburgh Potato Pancake.  It was pretty good.  I wouldn't have known there was bacon on it had the menu not mentioned it, but pretty much everyone at the table enjoyed it (and there was enough that 8 guys were all able to have a bit of it).\\n\\nThe entr\\u00e9es were fantastic. Since I don't think cows are all that tasty, I had and enjoyed the crabcakes.  A good amount of crab, not too much breading at all.  The roasted corn ancho chile sauce was a great compliment to them.\\n\\nEveryone else had steak and all loved it.  The only complaint was the coffee and cocoa crusted flat iron steak was incredibly small.  Temperatures ordered ranged from medium rare to medium well.  It looked to me like everything was cooked less than requested but no one was upset at doneness.  They looked delicious.  It's a joy to see a well cooked steak.  Made me wish i liked eating them.\\n\\nThe cotton candy after the meal.  Awesome.  Would have skipped the underwhelming dessert had I know it was coming.\\n\\nThe bad: We'd heard about how before ordering the meats were presented and explained.  We did not get this service, but did see it other tables getting it.\\n\\nOur group's wine snob described the wine list as \\\"\"terrible.\\\"\"  Nobody likes him though.  \\n\\nOur waitress didn't seem to know what beers they had.  The draft selection was limited to Bud's finest.  When asked what they had in bottles she replied \\\"\"almost everything\\\"\" before shooting down several requests (Dogfish Head, Stella Artois, and Newcastle are a few I remember off the top of my head).\\n\\nThe guys that ordered the french onion soup thought it was delicious, but were upset that it was barely warm to the point it was hard to break through the cheese.\\n\\nDessert looked fantastic, but wasn't so good to eat.  The chocolate cake is incredibly rich, but merely ok.  The \\\"\"warmed\\\"\" apple tart came cold.\\n\\nThey apparently don't believe in serving coffee with dessert either, as it came out a good 15 minutes after (and they neglected to offer milk or sugar). \\n\\nIf you're just going for dinner and aren't concerned about the extras (like service) the steaks were considered fantastic by all.  If you want a full restaurant experience (as you should be entitled to for their prices) you might be better off finding another place in the city.", "Tried to have dimmer here. 5:12 and still closed.

Today I was on the hunt for a gift for someone who wears a zero (or 2 or 4 depending on what it is) and as usually, no one in the store even acknowledged I was there  I walked in.  No greeting.

Very friendly and sincere. Other than that service was mediocre! We had the pineapple upside down pancakes which had no upside downness at all! No brown sugar and no sauce!

Well, when this place was Terrible's Casino you probably could have gotten all that. Located a hop from the airport, close enough to the strip to see some action if you'd like, and a great \\\"\"no-frills\\\"\" deal for the economy minded or business traveler Terrible's was that. In the past year, though the Terrible Herbst company has drifted away from gambling establishments and sold to Affinity Gaming where Terrible's Hotel & Casino is now the Silver Sevens Resort.\\n\\nHere's my review of the place when it was Terrible's:\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=F4_zHEXU1p5E12A2o-5_ZQ&q=terribles\\n\\nNone of this is true anymore as they completely overhauled the establishment. Well, aside from the aesthetics. It's still looks like a Vegas local's spot with a tight casino ground floor and second story loft style area for dining, bingo, and a few more games. It's everything else that has changed.\\n\\nDining\\nOne of Terrible's greatest appeals was it's dining deals. There were great $9.99 meal deals that included prime rib and a roasted half chicken. Graveyard specials included $2.99 bacon and eggs breakfast. The buffet at Terrible's wasn't the best but at affordable prices and the frequent BOGO tickets that could be found, the low price trumped the limited selection. These are all but a memory as prices have gone up and having a player's card only gets you $1 off. The graveyard specials are now limited to the single menu item and those wonderful $9.99 are gone completely. \\n\\nHotel\\nFor a reasonable price, Terrible's room were a great deal. On top of those wonderful secret \\\"\"resort fees\\\"\" that they tack on now (this is everywhere now), Silver Sevens now includes a $100 deposit to any stay! Keep in mind, this isn't just $100 for the room in which they will refund you (usually in 48 hours), this is ON TOP OF your room stay amount that they authorize for. The worst part is that they NEVER tell you this when you book the room. You just show up and they tell you this as you hand them your card and ID. If it's a slow night, be prepared to argue with the front desk supervisor about canceling your reservation without notice, too.\\n\\nAmenities\\nForget it, there are none. Even the WiFi in the rooms are no longer free. Which was a HUGE reason why I would stay there. If you're a gambler, drink wait times are excessive and the pool isn't heated. Can't say much about the room itself because I didn't want to drop the deposit. I will say that the location is great and close to everything. \\n\\nMy $.02\\nSilver Sevens is a HUGE disappointment of what used to be a great hidden gem a city that's at the ready to gouge you of all your money. As a former local, I used to enjoy going there because it was a great deal. It was a great place for locals to enjoy some of what their city provides without obligating to the strip. Perhaps Silver Sevens is trying to re-brand and compete for the same market as their neighbors the Hard Rock. I don't know but it seems like Station Casinos or even Sam's Town might be the winner of this.\\n\\nGiving the \\\"\"new\\\"\" Silver Sevens a 1 Star for the overall suck of the place now that it's not Terrible's. Which is a huge drop as compared to the 4 Stars I gave it's predecessor.", "I was a little disappointed when I ate at the House of Leng.

I haven't been here in a couple of yrs. It was really good back then.I don't know if they changed management but I will not be returning back. I ordered the shrimp and broccoli w/ garlic sauce and brown rice. Is it me but how come when I ask a Chinese restaurant for brown rice they think I'm talking about fried rice. NO!!! The rice was kind of hard and stale. The shrimp and garlic sauce was a bit on the salty side. \\n\\nThe rest of the food that the family ate was nothing to write about. You would think since it's conventionally located in a popular shopping plaza they would keep you coming back for more. Sorry house of Leng I'm no longer a fan.

I looked at an empty glass of water numerous time, and when we asked about dessert the waitress told us that we could get up and go look at the display! Food was delicious though, I'll give the kitchen staff that much.

The place wasn't very packed - there were plenty of tables available at 7pm on a Friday, so we were seated right away. \\n\\nThe way the place is set up, we were seated right near the bar and our table was bar height. This meant that we had to endure assholes squeezing past to go to the shitter and people leaving their drinks on our table or leaning on it. It was pretty awful. I understand they have a popular bar, but this is a restaurant too. It would be a really easy fix to solve this problem.\\n\\nOn to the food... it was shit. The dishes are somewhat inspired by mexican cuisine, but they are rather bland and kinda gross. The burrito I had was horrible - dog food. It smelled rank and I couldn't finish it. The salad wasn't bad, but it was boring. My girl got shrimp tacos and ended up feeling ill later in the night. She wasn't at all impressed.\\n\\nDrinks - I had a house margarita on rocks with salt. It was pretty tasty, but lacked a fair amount of alcohol... plus, it has given me a headache - I'm blaming cheap tequilla. My girl had a signature margarita - I tasted it and it was decent, but a little too sweet. They had a 'wine tasting' of their own label wine as well. They had a chardonnay and a pinot noir/chardonnay mix... we had a taste of the latter and it literally tasted like a mimosa made with rancid orange juice that was sopped up with a dirty dishrag and squeezed into the glass.\\n\\nEveryone in the joint was either an old ugly dude or a high-school girl wearing big sister's clothes or gay couples.

( I already had the flu this year so I'm probably at no risk :) \\n\\nSo I get called in at 5:15pm, and I am walked into a testing room by one of their technicians named \\\"\"Sandy\\\"\". She asks me a few questions (What are you here for, how long have you worn contacts for, how often do you change your lenses, etc) When she asks how long I normally wear my lenses for, I truthfully tell her \\\"\"Normally 2-4 weeks\\\"\", She scolds me and says \\\"\"IF they are two week lenses you need to throw them out after two weeks or the Optometrist will not write you a prescription!\\\"\"  I agree with her just so I can continue on with the process knowing fully that I will continue to wear my 2 week lenses for a month to save money. She then tries to sell me an additional test that will cost $15. I decline, and she says \\\"\"Well I hope the Dr is ok with this and still writes you a prescription because he really needs these tests...\\\"\"\\n \\nAfter a few of the other eye tests that do not cost any additional fees, I finally get moved to another waiting room, which is the final one before the Dr ( I feel like Super Mario waiting to meet Bowser in the castle at this point, but still in good spirits). Then Dr Thomas Cheney calls me into his office and does a full exam on my eyes. He asks how long I've worn lenses and I told him about 10 years, and I really like the brand so I would like to stay with them (Acuvue Oasys with Hydraclear Plus--Best lenses ever!) So he says \\\"\"Well I want you to try these on, these are America's Best favorite lenses, very breathable.\\\"\" So I say \\\"\"Sure, but honestly I am planning on taking the prescription and ordering my trusted brand online like I've done for 10 years.\\\"\" He says, well I can't write you a prescription for that because we don't have any here to test you in but we can special order them in.\\\"\" But in the meantime wear these, and maybe you will like them and want to buy them from us, we do have very competitive pricing\\\"\" I said \\\"\"No I want a prescription for what brand I've had for 10 years, and I am ordering online.\\\"\" He declined and said I'd have to come back to do the next fitting once they right lenses come in.\\n\\nI then go to the front counter and tell them about my experience and that I am upset because I now have to come back for another fitting for the same lenses I've worn for 10 years. The nice girls at the counter tell me they will look to see if they have them in stock even after the Dr said they had to be ordered. They MIRACULOUSLY find a pair and I say \\\"\"Great, now he can see me and write the prescription\\\"\", and I am quickly shut down with the old \\\"\"Well we're closing soon so it will have to be another day\\\"\" So basically I spent 2.5 hours at this place to get a prescription for a brand I do not like, and the Dr marks the prescription \\\"\"Dispense as Written\\\"\", so I can only get that brand until he writes for a new prescription after a second fitting.\\n\\nBottom line, the PRESCRIPTION IS KEY here, they will dangle it over your head and try to convince you to buy the $15 test, and buy THEIR BRAND of lenses from them. They want to sell you contact lenses, and they seem to do whatever it takes to get you into the brand of lenses they want to sell you as well. My suggestion, stand your ground, and do not pay for anything until you get the prescription that works best for you.", "I just threw about $20 worth of their food in the trash. I will never go back.\\n\\nI ordered 2 items to go. The chicken coconut soup had a great flavor so I was enchanted...at first.\\n\\nThen as I stirred up the soup from the bottom of the container I found slices of chicken that were extremely chewy and bland, almost as if the meat was old.  Ok, I can eat around the chicken, I thought, but no....there were hard inedible shreds of lemongrass like floating pieces of straw that made the remainder of the soup unsalvageable.\\n\\nThen I tried the Pad Pik King. Oh dear.  The string beans were partially cooked and very tough. I couldn't locate a single piece of beef that didn't have gristle in it. But hey, the plain white rice was okay and generous!\\nDon't bother.  Really.", "The interior quality and the VIP seating with alcohol is a great addition to this theater but the crowds are terrible. For some reason every time I go here the people at this place are ultra loud, talking on their cell phones, yelling to each other, etc. It makes it nearly unbearable to watch a movie here. And it's not just me, it's most everyone I know that has had these same experiences. All of my friends avoid this place anymore.\\n\\nIt's definitely a trade-off. If you want booze and super comfy seats, and don't mind dealing with some noisy people, this is a good pick.\\n\\nIf you want quiet, head to the SouthSide Works theater.", "I have not known a person who spoke of this place in anything but glowing terms. This was over many years. I have had their food a few times and felt the fish was like cardboard and nothing to speak well of.", "I am not a ramen fanatic, but I ate it regularly while living in Japan, which I did for many years. I've also had ramen in U.S. restaurants a handful of times. \\n\\nThe good news is that the pork buns and gyoza were very good (but not stellar).\\n\\nThe bad news is that the miso ramen really missed the mark. The soup tasted to me like they just dumped some miso into another soup base. I didn't catch any sweetness or toban-jan flavor...very, very far away from any miso ramen I have had in the U.S. or Japan. It wasn't bad per se, but they shouldn't call it miso ramen either. \\n\\nAlso, I got a clump of uncooked noodles in my bowl. Really. Y'know how sometimes noodles settle a little early and get stuck? This was not that. This was a large knot (about the size of an egg, but slimmer) that could not be teased apart. I pulled it out of my bowl and put it on a plate. When I cut it open with my spoon, I saw that the clump was still raw in the middle. I have never had that happen before, anywhere. \\n\\nThe only reason I give them two stars and not one is that the pork buns and gyoza countered some of the damage that the ramen did.", "Wow. I just wish I could tell the people there on Monday at around 5-5:30, that you are lucky that I punched the fence and not your face.\\n\\nWhat a nightmare. Most of the dogs there ran over mine, only one stepped up. Apparently her dog just likes to play with little dogs. Really, is that why your mutt attacked mine when we were in between the exit gates trying to leave?  It's ok, he just likes to play, right? I do have to give her some credit because at least she kind of tried (obviously not hard enough). Unlike ALL the others that just sat there. I saw two dogs take massive dumps and no one did anything. This was like a minefield of dump.Then I got the pleasure of stepping in a pile and squishing it into my Adidas. I asked if anyone cleaned their dogs shit, no response. But a couple with an ugly crap dog laughed. Another that repeatedly ran over mine and all they could say, \\\"\"oh stop pickin on that dog\\\"\" NOT BOTHERING TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM THE BENCH! It took all I had not to show them something that was really funny. My dog getting trampled and yelping and stepping in dog shit, not funny. Taking my poop shoe and rubbing it in your face....now that is hilarious. But I refrained.\\nBy the time I pulled that dog off mine (which was followed by someones stupid mouth) I thought, hit the fence out of sheer anger, or go to jail for beating someone? I chose fence. Not a peep came out of peoples mouths then. Don't let the blond hair and small dogs fool you, I will beat you down like your momma obviously should have.\\n\\nIf you got a big dog and it chases the little dogs and tramples them, do yourself a solid and CONTROL YOUR DOG. Because the next time, it could be mine that it trampled, and I'm out of free passes on that situation.", "Got a gel manicure there on Monday 01.28.2012, by that evening it was chipping.  Today, Thursday, 01.31.2012, 6 1/2 nails have had the color peel off.  Also, the color has yellowed.  The guy that did the manicure fiiled my nails after the color was put on.

Stay away from this place and it's doctors!  Don't risk your health and well being!", "Attended the 15th anniversary and had a mixed experience.  How can you knock 15 cent beer, pizza and wings?  I can't, especially when the beer is pretty damned good.  Now the bad news...the service.  I was standing in line at the beer stand near the sports book.  I didn't mind waiting because they were fairly busy due to the cheap prices.  As I got to the front, I was second in line.  The guy behind me asked the guy pouring the beer a question and to my surprise the server asked him what he wanted and helped him.  The lady in front of me turned and said \\\"\"I guess we wasted our time standing in line.\\\"\"  The other server, a blond lady finally helped us.  When it was my turn, I ordered 4 beers.  She told me that she could only give me 2.  That would be fine except that 2 out of the 3 people in front of me were served 3 each by her.  I only remember that because I was trying to figure out how to carry 4 and was watching how they carried their 3.  If the rule is 2 per customer, fine, but don't arbitrarily enforce the rules.  It made me feel discriminated against and irritated me the rest of the night.  I hadn't been in there for years but was enjoying my night.  In an instant, it turned and now I won't be back over something that could have been avoided.", "The Yard was a bit of an overwhelming experience for me.  We had reserved 'outdoor' seats at Little Cleo's, not realizing that outdoor actually means in the yard.  Being in the yard on a Saturday night is certainly one of those things you should be prepared for.  For the amount of money spent on our meal, it was disappointing that conversation was difficult over the roar of the crowd.  Very reminiscent of my college days, and spending time in a bar on Mill.  I could barely hear the server!   While waiting for our table (20 min wait with reservations) we sauntered over to the bar that services the yard and Culinary Dropout.  My husband's beer cost as much as my mojito.  It wasn't that the mojito was cheap, but the fact they charged a crazy amount for a beer.  It was almost 8 bucks.  The worst part, as others have said, is the parking.  Valet was full, so we had to park across the street in a shopping center and run across five lanes of traffic.   I will say that once I accepted that I wasn't going to be having a fine dining experience (though I certainly paid for it) I was able to just sit back and enjoy the people watching.  This place was fun for people watching.  There were bikers, ping-pongers, and that funny drunk guy who was laughing way too loud at his own jokes.  So, essentially the Yard provided dinner and a show.  The cover band playing at Culinary was a fun touch too.  All in all, I had fun.  That being said, I will probably never go back.", "Oh, yuk.\\n\\nTen years ago, this place used to at least be tolerable, but any more I can't drive past it without sneering and saying, 'oh, yuk.'\\n\\nThe meat is low grade, no matter what kind.  The chicken is fatty, the beef is tough.  Anything fried tastes like oil and not like the food it's supposed to be.  Their sauces are so thick they're more like glazes, and the sugary ones will almost send you into a diabetic coma.  The rice isn't cooked correctly and even the fortune cookie I got last time was stale.\\n\\nAdd to the fact that the people working there are usually not very accommodating or friendly and that the place is filthy, and there's not a thing in the world that would take me back here.", "Unfortunately this is the only place on Lake Wylie to eat when you are out on your boat other than a snack bar. The deck and the boat docks are the only reason they are still in business. If you want a drink order beer or wine. The drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited.  The food leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up. We were wrong.  The chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor.  The filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing. The cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product, the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting.  The hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre.  The fries were mushy and limp.   On top of all this the place appears grungy and dated.  The place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it. This is the last chance we are giving this place.  Hopefully everyone will also give up on it so a decent place can be moved in, but I think the building is beyond saving at this point.", "The first thing that you notice is that the food is overpriced.\\nThen you taste it.\\nThe worst burger I have ever had.

Even then they did not complete the drawing showing a thorough treatment as required by the state.", "After having issues in the past at this location I decided to give it another try as I was visiting for the holidays. I pulled in, was greeted and they filled my tank up. I asked for \\\"\"the works\\\"\" wash and my ticket was written up. I knew the approximate price of the gas I needed and the price of the wash so I didn't think twice when I was rung up inside. After I paid I looked at my receipt and I had a surcharge for a large vehicle. I drive a  small vw sedan. I couldn't believe they tried to sneak the surcharge past me. I walked in and requested they refund me. They gal at the check-out said my ticket had been written with a surcharge.. Yeah the guy who filled the gas tank of my small sedan thought I wouldn't notice a surcharge. I won't be going back here, I will take my absurdly large Jetta to one of the many other car washes in Scottsdale.", "I decided to try this place out despite the bad reviews because it was packed.  This was probably due to it being 69 cent taco night (Sunday).  It was a mistake.  The chips and salsa were both bland,  my diet coke was watered down,  and the 69 cent tacos were also very bland.  My girlfriend ordered a margarita with no salt,  which arrived with salt.  We told the waiter she asked for no salt and he argued with us,  saying she never said that.  She just settled for what was brought to her.  After we asked for the check the waiter walked by several times serving other tables until we had to ask for the check a second time.  The service sucked and so did the food.  The only good thing about the experience was the price.  I don't recommend it.", "Holy smokes does this place suck.\\n\\nI was told by someone that is was like Chipolte, only better.

The service was ok, not too friendly, and didn't try too hard. That's ok, it isn't fine dining. The prices were higher than Chipolte, so maybe the flavors were better?\\n\\nGetting back to the office we started in on this lunch. The best way to describe it, is space food. They say that in space food doesn't have flavor, so on the bright side, for the cost of lunch it was like being in space. The carne asada had ZERO flavor. The guac had no salt, garlic, nada. Just avacado. So weird? The rice in the burro had no flavor either, I don't know if the food was props for movies, or what?\\n\\nSkip this place, go a mile down the road for Chipolte, or head just West to America's Tacos.", "Horrendously underemployed.

Upon entering, we found ourselves in a long line of yelper foodies in the same situation as we were. The decor is modern and the ordering set up is like a fast food joint: wait in line, order, find a seat and wait for your food. The wait was about 20 minutes and there are tvs set up to enjoy while waiting at your table. Although important, these details are not by any means the reason for a two star review. The food and the pricing was actually a bit over hyped. Our meal, for two people, cost almost $30 and the portions were VERY small. I ordered the baguette french toast which was chewy, tasty, and pretty small. This dish is an off shoot from traditional french toast which and was ordinary at best. The bacon that accompanied this dish was very good and you only get two slices. I also ordered a side of rosemary potatoes for around $3 which were dry and cold. My girlfriend got the meat lovers scramble and considering the name of the restaurant, we figured this breakfast would be a sure shot. Well it wasnt. The scramble was skimpy, dry, bland, light on the meat, and came with the same rosemary potatoes and hard cold toast. Also, we were very dissappointed with the cinnamon roll because it did not look anything like it did in the picture. It was dry and slathered with overpowering cream cheese frosting. The only saving grace for this place was the orange juice, which seemed to be freshly squeezed, and the coffee. We won't be returning for another visit.", "We've stayed at the Rio a couple times in the last year and after the second visit I've noticed a few details that will affect our decision to return or not. The hotel is starting to appear run down - it's the little things. Many of the buttons in the elevator are broken, the carptet is looking tired and frayed, the broken elevator floor indicator had a clear piece of plexiglass covering the LED display so that all the electronics were visible. I don't think these are huge issues, but they tend to wear on you when you obtain a good rate and then add 50% of that rate as a resort fee so that great rate isn't so great after all. The hotel is really in a convenient location and I'd like to return due to the convenience. Maybe I should check out the pool before making the final decision.

I fully understand that, often enough, Vegas satellites tend to be only a shadow of their non-Vegas counterparts, but I was not prepared for the level of my disappointment at BARMASA.\\n\\nEven approaching the hostess desk at BARMASA I felt a sense of excitement (despite the incorrect signage in the Aria Casino directing you to \\\"\"Masa\\\"\"--I can now speculate on the story behind that).  That excitement immediately evaporated the second I turned the corner around the entryway and viewed the main dining area:  Certainly \\\"\"consistent\\\"\" (to put it as kindly as possible) with the rest of Aria's decor, but uninspiring and, frankly, gloomy.  Granted, it was 6pm on a Wednesday, so possibly the \\\"\"vibe\\\"\" of the restaurant was not at its peak, but I could not help but feel utterly deflated...and this was even before I thought about the food.\\n\\nEven though I was meeting up with a friend, I was first invited to dine at the bar.  I thought this could be a real treat--the \\\"\"bar\\\"\" area at Masa (where your food is prepared right in front of you) is an incredible experience, especially on top of the NYC restaurant's beautiful Japanese hinoki wood counter.  Not at BARMASA:  Their bar is just a plain, old uninspiring bar.  A little surprising for Vegas not to splurge on a highlight like a hinoki wood counter (even if it might be at the cost of the quality of the food).  I opted for a table--the host explaining how the bar overlooks the entire restaurant reminded me of a real estate agent trying to explain away a defect as a design feature.\\n\\nWith respect to the food, all of the reviewers are spot-on in saying that it is overpriced.  I would be okay with the prices if the food was of matching quality, but this was not the case at BARMASA.  The Kobe Beef  and Garlic Fried Rice ($34) was rather pedestrian, and nothing about the dish appropriately highlighted the kobe beef.  The Nameko and Tofu Miso Soup was okay and a relative bargain at $9.  The Masa \\\"\"Toro Toro\\\"\" Roll ($48)--a slightly-on-the-large-side five-piece roll featuring the fatty Bluefin tuna--was a bland mess.  I would recommend instead just getting a $9 piece or two of toro from the a la carte menu.  There was very limited substance taste-wise to the Chicken Yakitori Skewers ($30).  The lone bright spot among the dishes we had was the Peking Duck with Foie Gras in Moo-Shu Skin ($26).  It was so good (and relatively small at just four pieces) that we got another one.  (This, sadly, should also give you a sense of the small portions you get for your money at BARMASA.)  In fact, the Peking Duck is the only thing that is saving BARMASA from getting a one-star review in my book.\\n\\nService was good, although maybe a little lacking in attentiveness.  Do not expect a high level of service that you might expect when spending the same amount of money at another restaurant.", "I ordered the Double Steak Burger California Style without the buns because I'm on a low carb diet.  It was good to know that they can accommodate you on that front.  So  my burger was kind like the protein burger from In and Out.  The only problem was, the patties were under seasoned.  I think this may have been the first time ever I had to salt my burger.  The patties were smashed so they're flat kinda like smash burgers' patties.  I was a bit disappointed about how, the only difference between my burger and whatever it is my husband ordered was that, mine had tomatoes.  I wish they could have made it more exciting like perhaps adding avocados to go with the title, \\\"\"California Style\\\"\".\\n\\nI have yet to try the frozen custard.  I hope its worth coming back for.", "After reading the reviews of this restaurant's other locations, I am at a complete loss for words -- is this supposed to be some great local gem or something?

I was surprised to see the prices on the lunch menu, though -- $10-$11 for vegetarian dishes like cheese enchiladas or a veggie burrito seemed really high. I went with the burrito, enchilada style. It tasted good. The tortilla was a bit chewy but the veggies were nice. \\nOk.\\nThat's it.\\nI get that this is supposed to be \\\"\"Mexican city\\\"\" style food, whatever that means.

I actually pawed around in the bottom of bag a bit to see if we missed anything. For $19, we had 2 gyros and sides.. a lot of money for not a lot of food. Gyros were very salty, small, dry..and .. well, I've had better :( Maybe I'm homesick for Chicago, and what a universe of Greek food there was out there.. lemon/garlic potatoes, tender gyro slices cuddled in hand-stretched pita.. there's no way this place could compete against, say, Cross Rhodes in Evanston, Illinois, or Larsa's in Skokie, IL.

We'd decided on an onion soup and salad to start. Basic, to the point.  Lamb was their specialty, so we thought the chops looked good. They did, but they weren't particularly flavourful, nor warm.

I was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes. How cool is that?? But upon doing some internet research before we ordered, I found out that due to cooking methods, ALL of the dishes wouldn't be vegan OR vegetarian. They cook everything on the same grill as the meat. What sense does this make? None. It's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted. If you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point? \\n\\nAnd here comes why it is 2-star. IT IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE VEG*N MENU TO BE COOKED IN A SEPARATE PAN. You have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill. Hmm - do you really think a vegan WANTS dead cow mixed in with her food? HELL NO. Granted, Yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else. But they haven't specified that ALL the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay. It would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat. If I hadn't had my phone on me that night, I literally would have gotten sick since I haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years. \\n\\nHere's what I would suggest: just like other companies before you (Chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/Gardein items cooked separately from the meat. You don't want a lawsuit a la McDonald's. It is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian. Oh and this isn't just for this Yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, I will be contacting your corporate offices today. Also, it would be nice if you could put a little V next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu. Makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.\\n\\nAnyways, I ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Matt ordered a thai \\\"\"chicken\\\"\" pizza. After some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so I got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce. The sweet potato fries we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster. Very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything. We couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so I guess that's where all the flavor is. After the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food. Do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders? NOTHING else? No tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard? For serious? The taste of the Gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous. The fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price. I wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders. At least then I could have had the wheat bun and toppings. \\n\\nIt was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress. I know it was very busy and that I did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja. Not the best customer service in the world. I also unfortunately don't see this Gardein line lasting here at Yardhouse. Until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, I can see a lot of vexed veg*ns. Honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats? I just don't get that logic. Yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and I understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can. Plain sliders are not okay. In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders. \\n\\nDue to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, Yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but I still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu. The intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon. I might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when I want to deal with the headaches and the hassle. Until then, I'll stock up on Gardein at Whole Foods and make my own delights at home.", "We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon 8/17, for a cold beer and some BBQ on the outdoor patio. Our server greeted us promptly and the beer came soon after. We ordered the pork sliders and and the pulled pork dogs. Food arrived promptly which was nice, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment. The pork on the sliders was dry and tasted like it had been sitting around a while. The fries were limp and barely warm. The slider buns overwhelmed and further \\\"\"dried\\\"\" out the sliders. Maybe the slider bread would have been better  if it had been toasted. The pulled pork dogs were equally dry and very salty. The house chips were just plain bad. My friend convinced me to try one. I wish I hadn't. They tasted like they had been fried in old grease. Pretty bad. Our lunch seemed to be made with no love. We were very disappointed. We thought about complaining, but the foul odor from a pile of cigarette butts that the table across from us had created (on the ground under their table) was drifting our way, so we decided to just get our check and leave.

Is anyone running this place?)\\n\\nI hope Queen City Q can get their act together but we won't be heading back anytime soon.", "Worst hotel / time share or whatever you want to call it.  Room service is non existent.

I asked for limes to make drinks in my room before we went to XS for the night each lime cost $4.00, really?  Most hotels give you limes and other condiments if needed.  I ordered extra blankets for the pull out couch and it took them almost two hours to get them to my room. (its not even a holiday weekend)  I would much rather stay at the regular Planet Hollywood or just pay the extra price and stay somewhere that respects me more and could get me into the clubs for staying with them.", "I just had the most bizarre experience at this store. My family had lunch at a restaurant across from the store. We needed a couple things and some brews for hanging by the pool. So figured we would run in.\\n\\nI went threw the check out line and paid up. Grabbed my bags a my 12 pack. Walk towards the door and waited for my wife and kids. My kids are fooling with the balloons of course.\\n\\nThey headed over so I went to walk out and some random lady walked in front of me. She walked in front of me and cut me off which was rude I thought. But I even said sorry for getting in her way. \\n\\nSo I step to the left to walk again and she walks in front of me. So now i figure out she is doing this on purpose and keeps mumbling incoherently under her breath. \\n\\nAt this point I figured she was drunk or psychotic. But I wasn't going to be rude. So I politely try to walk past again and now she is standing with her back to me physically not letting me out of the store. \\n\\nThen she starts yelling Matt...Matt..did you check this guy? So now I get it she thinks I'm stealing. She asks if I paid for my beer? I had my receipt in my left hand and said yes. \\n\\nI still have no idea who this person is....she still is mumbling so I said what did you say? No answer she does not even make eye contact. \\n\\nBy then Matt runs over and says your good and starts talking to the lady. He obviously is the manager on duty. So they walk away talking and another employee who is a bagger by the way tells me alot of people steal beer from them. So it's my fault for buying beer there? \\n\\nSo I am calling the GM tomorrow to get some answers.", "I have been to this Ted Wiens a couple of times & have'nt had any problems.\\\"\"Keep in mind that I only went there for a tire change & smog check\\\"\".

I took my truck in & after 1 hour from the time I dropped it off they said that they cleaned something (I forget) & that the problem was solved, they suggested that I get 2 other things done as a precaution & all of this would be under $500. Feeling better that it was'nt anything major I told them to go ahead. The next day after this service I notice the same problem, took it back to them & they said to keep driving it & it will eventually go away. 3 days went past with NO relief so I took it to Findlay Toyota were they broke the bad news. My girlfriend had sludge,(which they showed me) in the motor & to get the smoke to stop it would cost $5000 for a new one or $3000 to clean this one. If I would've known this from Ted Weins I would've not gone through with the $500 repair. I went back to Ted Weins & they said Toyota was wrong,(even after I saw it with my own eyes) & after arguing with the rude manager & the mechanic who worked on my car(who was puffing up his chest like he wanted to fight) they gave me $62 back for the labor. \\n\\nThat was a crock of bull!!!", "I first arrived in Vegas too early to check into Circus Circus, so I stayed at the local Red Roof Inn for a few hours to get some sleep. \\n\\nI wish I would have just stayed at the Red Roof Inn the entire time, because it was so much nicer than this massively gross hotel. \\n\\nThe only positive about this place is the massive free parking garages that they have. That's it. \\n\\nBetween the air conditioning in the rooms that hardly worked, the disgusting elevators, the difficult staff, the annoyingly pushy housekeeping people, the overpriced food/alcohol/EVERYTHING that they have in their building, it makes for an unpleasant experience. \\n\\nCircus Circus is probably the cheapest large hotel out of all the big ones in Vegas - But do yourself a favor, whether you're coming with kids, or a significant other, save your money, stay at the nicely remodeled Red Roof Inn down the street where you'll save a ton of money that you can then spend on doing fun stuff in Vegas.

There's not a wide variety of restaurants on Madison's north side, so I was hoping to find a decent, new dining spot close to home.  I order the fish dinner and a grilled cheese for my daughter.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it was not the kitchen's best performance.  It seemed like the staff just assembled and warmed Sysco ingredients.  The kitchen did not apply much in the way of creativity or technique to either dish.\\n\\nThe fish dinner ($12.99) suffered from a lack of seasoning and a lack of any texture.  The breading was bland and lacked any crunch. The texture of the fish also was mushier than other fish fries I've had.  The small serving of tartar sauce suffered from the same lack of seasoning - I could not detect any lemon or herbs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the cottage fries were soggy and had far too much salt.  While the portion size was generous, I was unable to finish them.\\n\\nThe slaw looked promising and added some much-needed crunch to the meal.  However, it just had an off taste and I quit eating it after a couple of bites.  \\n\\nThe dinner roll was a standard issue roll for a fish dinner.  Nothing spectacular, but I enjoyed it.\\n\\nMy daughter enjoyed for grilled cheese ($2.99), especially the cheddar cheese.  They actually grilled the sandwich because the griddle had been turned off. The sandwich had grill marks and the cheese was melted through.  Other than the overly salty fries, it was a great meal for the price.  My daughter preferred this grilled cheese sandwich over was she gets from Culver's.\\n\\nThe ordering process was efficient and the staff was friendly when I picked up the food.  I also am a fan of any place that offers free popcorn.\\n\\nDespite the mediocre food this visit, I will try Brat und Brau again because of my positive interactions with the staff and a streak of nostalgia.  However, I'll stick to the bratwurst and request the kitchen go easy on the salt.", "While the concept of Brooklyn Bowl is good and the space for a small concert is great.

We were wondering why our food was taking so long, when our waitress popped over to tell us that \\\"\"the printer hadn't printed\\\"\" our order, so we had fallen behind.  I am not sure whether that was the truth or not, but when one of our party (half-jokingly) asked if they were going to adjust our bill, she made some snide little joke about all she could do was keep our water glasses filled.  And guess what--she didn't even do that!\\n\\nWhen the food finally came, it was pretty bland, and the portions were very small for the price they charge.  I didn't want to pig out, but I left hungry. \\n\\nOther small annoyances: \\n-the hostess who sat us was quite rude, at one point informing us that we needed to move because we were \\\"\"in the way.\\\"\"  Ok, that's reasonable, but that's not how you talk to a customer.

He immediately started to get loud and say that I \\\"\"didn't make any sense\\\"\" and that he'd asked everyone at the bar to pick music out of the money he put in. I told him that was ridiculous and that he had no business buying out a shitload of credits when he had customers that want to pay for their music.

Mr. Asshat comes out of his office and asks if we know a friend  named  \\\"\"so & so\\\"\"  we answered \\\"\"yes we know her\\\"\". He starts to raise his voice by telling us that because of an unpleasant YELP review that was written from her & my boyfriend, that we were 86'd from the bar. My bf had written a negative review when the first incident happened and apparently it hurt his feelings. He starts muscling me out of his bar and calls me an \\\"\"ass\\\"\" I tell him that we weren't paying for the drinks and asked him to stop touching me, there is another yelling match and we leave.

Called the front desk got put on hold for 25 minutes but talked to two people that picked up but were not managers. Tracy at the front desk stated that they thought it had been fixed and she was sorry and that some of the towers have BEEN having issues. Finally after 25 minutes Ricardo the manager got on the phone and of course I was pissed asked what they are doing to compensate, he said he could refund the resort fee of $20.16 and that was all. He was VERY UNHELPFUL AND RUDE. HE STARTED THAT IT WOULD BE FIXED IN AT LEAST AN HOUR AND IT IS 11:20 pm now. I asked if we could at least switch rooms and he said they had no rooms left. I went online right after and they had plenty of rooms. I also asked why they did not inform me at check in and he said that they did not know about the issues, WHICH WAS A LIE. Tracy at the front desk told me they were having issues already and knew know about it. NOT HAVING ANYMORE ROOMS WAS ALSO A LIE. The manager Ricardo treated me like I was was hustling for a free room, but I think if you pay for a hotel room the least you can get is hot water. The total lack of customer service by  manager to do anything about it was unbelievable. If they would have told me from the get go about the hot water I would have gone to Harrahs next door. So they choose to lie to us to get our money. I just called again and talked to manager Josh who was very nice and said he could move us to another room,(but Ricardo said there were no rooms)that again proved he was lieing. My daughter is sleeping so we can't change rooms now but would have loved to 4 hours ago when we first checked in. JOSH the competent manager also have us a thirty dollar credit for breakfast or drinks, why was Ricardo such an idiot and why is he a manager if he was not willing to do anything? I will never come back here. I work in the gaming industry and know they would comp a room in a second for a gamer or VIP but Ricardo would do nothing for a regular customer with a child.

The food itself is fine in taste, but they need to appreciate the importance of attractive food presentation. I go there because of the boxed meal.

The Taco Bell Big Box Meal, the Taco Bell Volcano Box Meal...it doesn't have to just be Taco Bell - Long John Silvers Snack Box, the KFC Guitar Hero Box... chances are, if its a box, I am going to eat it. So imagine my disappointment when the box meal comes in a bag. The server indicated they were out of boxes. This isn't the first time I have ordered from this location and went home box-less. It should be a simple analysis of sales, projection of sustainable demand and the appropriate number of boxes ordered. How difficult is that? Even worse, I get home with my Volcano Bag Meal and the volcano taco is busted in three places. It is more or less a volcano taco salad. The second taco was a regular taco and it was broken along the bottom - so one bite and the contents were on the paper. What are they doing back there with the tacos?  The cinnamon twists were fine and so was the volcano burrito - then again its more difficult to break a burrito...So Taco Bell, let's get the presentation down.

Even though it was Saturday night, the restaurant wasn't that full and we were seated fairly quickly. The decor is definitely nothing to speak of, but it was clean. The color scheme, particularly the pink and lilac napkins, was a little strange, but I guess it's supposed to go with the name.\\n\\nUnfortunately we were seated in an odd area in the back of the restaurant. I guess I would describe it as a corner banquette where we were sitting at a 90 degree angle instead of across from each other. There was an older couple in their 60s or so sitting at the other end of the banquette, and no one in the booths across from us. Throughout dinner the older couple were discussing breast implants, recreational drugs, and menopause the musical. Because the area we were seated in was so empty we couldn't help but overhear their conversation which made for a very unpleasant dining experience.\\n\\nOur server was a younger lady, I'd say late 20s/early 30s. From the moment she first came to our table things started off on the wrong foot. I was looking at the drinks menu and she made some comment about how I'm too young for that. Now I know that I look young and I don't have any problem with people saying that, but it was her tone that almost sounded like she was scolding me.\\n\\nAnyway, we went on to order and started off with an appetizer. I don't remember the name, but I jokingly called it a Thai quesadilla. It was chicken, peas, potatoes, and maybe some other stuff wrapped inside a flour tortilla and served with peanut dipping sauce. The tortilla was folded in half and then cut into four pieces. We both liked the taste and flavors a lot but found it very difficult to eat the middle two pieces without making a mess.\\n\\nFor entrees, I ordered pad see ew and my BF ordered pad thai. Both dishes were okay, but we've had better. For the pad thai, I'm used to seeing the crushed peanuts and bean sprouts come on the side for you to mix into the noodles yourself. But it wasn't served like that. For the pad see ew, this is the second Thai place I've tried in the valley and neither has done it right. First of all, I wish they'd use real Chinese broccoli instead of American broccoli, but I can overlook that. What I don't understand though is why I keep getting asked what degree of spicyness I want. In my experience, pad see ew isn't supposed to be spicy. It's supposed to be cooked with a sweet soy sauce. The noodles were good and had a nice soft texture, but the flavor that I want just wasn't there. Also I ordered it with pork and there was something off about the pork. I think it was either old or just a very poor cut of meat.\\n\\nNow here's why I ended up giving only two stars. By now the older couple had left and a new couple had been seated in one of the nearby boothes. Both tables had different servers who were very friendly and attentive. After we finished as much of our meals as we could, we sat with our plates untouched for 15-20 minutes and our server basically ignored us. I don't know if she forgot we were there or what. Also neither of the other two servers who kept passing by took notice that we were waiting to be boxed up and go. Finally I had to flag a server down and he went to get our server. She came and made some comment about how it looked like we were falling asleep (duh, we're tired of waiting) and then took our food to boxed up and brought back the check. Then she disappeared again for another 10 minutes before finally returning to pick up our credit card and ring us up.\\n\\nI'm disappointed because Pink Pepper is pretty close to our house and I was really hoping that this would become a place we could visit frequently. While I'm not outright ruling the possibility of returning, I think we'll have to try some other Thai places first.\\n\\nHowever, I do have to comment that I disagree with JBH J.'s review that the prices are high. I thought they were very reasonably priced.", "A good value with a great location, but has problems. The hotel is dated, but the rooms were recently updated and nice.

Not a hint of lemon, hardly a taste of garlic, overcooked shrimp, and I have never heard of adding bell pepper to scampi. Interesting, but suprisingly tasteless. It was very dry, not a drop of sauce at the bottom of the bowl. Also, for $15.99, I would expect a salad or garlic toast to come with my meal. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken with biscuits and gravy. Also, for the price of $13.99, you would think it would come with a salad or vegetable. It is exactly what it says... chicken, 2 biscuts, and a small side of gravy. The chicken, I would easily give a 7 out of 10. Cooked well and crispy, but a tad bland in the spice dept. The gravy had a very weird taste to it and seemed very floury. The biscuits were dry/stale and did not come with butter or anything.

If you have to tell customers this is real Mexican food, it likely not. And that is exactly what I found here on my first visit. \\nFirst of all they don't sell any \\\"\"Aguas frescas\\\"\". That's right no horchata here. \\nOrdered a Pepsi and got a rootbeer. \\nI ordered fajitas, which were very bland and over cooked. The plate of fajitas included more onions and pepper than actual meat.  Plus I think it was priced a little high at $14.95. \\nMy wife had a plate that included chipotle flavored steak. She disliked it so much that she asked to waiter to take it back. And they did. \\nThe tortillas were hardly warm. \\nThe one thing I did like was the salsa and the quick refills on chip and drinks. \\nI visited the restaurant with 5 other people and non of us care too much for this food.  \\nIn conclusion, I will not be returning to this place, nor will I recommend it. \\nIf you are in the mood for Mexican food, go else where.", "On April 23, 2012 we decided to take my daughter here for her 12th birthday.. Big mistake!!!! I still can't stop thinking about how horrible it was. We got there about 6:30 pm... Getting in was ok but if you have more then two people they put you aside and take care of smaller groups first.. The wait was ok but I heard other parties complaining that night about being set aside.. I do have to say our server was awesome .. Thanks RYAN .. However!!!! , the food was HoRRIBLE.. gross, Yuck .. There was no fish.. Except crawfish which you could tell nobody was touching..  Most of it was cold or like the turkey was dry .. I'm so disappointed..

That is the end of the positive aspects of this review.\\n\\nOk...So, maybe I came at the wrong time, it was Monday, and it was 1:45pm...so maybe that is what happened, but I gotta tell you, this is perhaps the worst dim sum I've ever had. Ouch, right? it's true! I am normally the fat kid in a candy shop when I'm at a dim sum joint, even if it isn't great, I'll eat every little bit. I left nearly two and a half full (of the 5 I ordered) plates on the table.\\n\\nHere are some specifics for those of you that want to know...\\n\\n1) The Shrimp Rice noodle...was OK...the shrimps were at least shrimpy and large, and the sauce was passable.\\n2) The Fried shrimp dumplings. ICK! These are some of my faves, because they are so easy to do, and so hard to screw up...Kam Fung...you screwed them up. It tasted as if someone had deep fried them, let them sit out for a couple hours, microwaved and then soaked them in Oil. They were the greasiest, unappetizing, foul little things ever...yick!\\n3) The pan fried shrimp and chive patty things...god...if I thought nothing could be worse than the fried shrimp dumplings...i was severely mistaken. These were literally falling apart...in a bad way...they had no flavor other than disgusting.\\n4) The Xiu Mai (pork dumpling) was tough, hot at least, but you ate it in full chunks, cause you had no choice\\n5) The char sui bao (bbq pork dumpling) was alright...but pretty flavorless and the pastry was yicky...\\n\\nHere's the worst of it...The soy sauce...was AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In a Kikoman bottle and was either 19 months past its due date, or was some knock off that was baked in the sun with sonny's secret sauce (lard). The soy sauce was greasy and coated everything with this OIL (think car oil) like quality. Seriously though...it was like the Exxon-Valdez all over again!  Thank god there were no penguins!\\n\\n\\nBy the way, the bathroom is around corner. It is not the one that requites a key however, if you are at that bathroom, go towards the restaurant and turn left at the next door. \\n\\nPlease...eat anywhere but here...like McDonalds, or Fishy Joes...", "Yea, Blu Basil looks like an airport restaurant, and it has potential, but their prices are too high. It should be $ instead of $$.", "Don't move into these apartment homes unless you love throwing away your money! I moved in and paid my holding, security, and cleaning fees. When I left after 3 years they charged me hundreds of dollars in more 'cleaning' fees. And the next person who moves in behind me will also be paying the fees twice too! They basically double charge every tenant. Despite the fact that I never took of advantage of the option for a repaint with a lease renewal (I never really had many scuffs or paint damage on my walls so why put maintenance through the trouble...?), when I moved out, they charged me for a repaint, carpet wear, and a spill in the fridge. Are you kidding me?! I lived there 3 years and kept the place immaculate and they forward me a bill for the wear and tear that any home would have after 3 years. I tried disputing the charges through the proper channels and was met with the standard run-around. The rent I was paying was already enough to give one pause but the property manager,Desirae, and Ovation Property Management are absolute crooks!!!", "Dumplings are way too greasy as is everything else.

Cru and D'Vine do not do that - I was there the other night, drinking my wine that had increased in price by the $5 fee when the waitress put down the check and said they were closing and she took the liberty to close out the tab - it was 7:45 PM - hello?  Also, watched people try to access the store but were turned away because it was too close to closing time.  Who runs an establishment this way?

I'll keep it brief.  The food was overpriced and the quality was so sub-par that we deeply regretted the fact that we were hungry and it was late.  If we had not been starving after a day of travel we would have vacated immediately.  Both entrees had so much msg dumped on them that they were GRITTY!  I've actually never had Chinese food so bad.

Truly terrible.  \\n\\nIn their defense, last year while attending the same conference I ate at the hibachi tables at Lillies and it was mediocre.", "Compared to Aloha Kitchen, this place just doesn't stack up. The meats are much saltier, and seem very processed, in comparison. The Kalua Pork lacks depth.. it tastes like it was soaked in liquid smoke, and salt for a few days... and the Katsu chicken is of school cafeteria quality.

We went on the weekend for dinner and payed $40each.\\n\\nI must say that it was a huge disappointment.  I used to be a fan of the Rio seafood buffet, but it has gone way down in quality over the years so I was really looking forward to getting some King Crab legs at the Bellagio, even though it is chilled and not steamed.  \\n\\nTo my dismay, the crab was not good.  Both the King & Snow crab had no flavor and some of it actually smelled like it was bad.  But I am not basing my review on the dismal crab.\\n\\nI had read many posts about how good the Kobe beef, and the Beef Wellington were, and numerous other items that were great, and they just weren't all that good.  \\n\\nThe \\\"\"Kobe\\\"\" beef tasted like dry roast beef.  The Beef Wellington was ok(never had it before), but it didn't knock my socks off.  The Lamb chops were a bit gamey, and I've had lots of Lamb.  One of the best things I've ever tasted was a  Lamb Chop on the Oregon Coast, and this wasnt' even close.\\n\\nThe sushi smelled foul and I only could muster up the courage to try the tuna, which was about what I would expect at a low dollar buffet. \\n\\nThe only high point was the Prime Rib and the very large & tasty Peel & Eat shrimp.  The Prime Rib was very good & the au jus was also really good.  The Prime Rib isn't as good as Lowry's Prime Rib, but it is top notch for Buffet Prime Rib.  I've had many disappointments with buffet Prime Rib, and the Bellagio isn't one of them.  \\n\\nThere were also a couple of vegitable dishes & other sides that were good, but for the price, I expected way more.  The buffet at Green Valley Ranch is a third of the cost, and the quality of the food is much better.  Not as much selection of high end stuff, but when the crab, Kobe Beef, & Sushi all suck really bad, the point becomes moot.\\n\\nI gave it two stars because between the peel & eat shrimp & the good Prime Rib, I think I got my $$ worth.", "There is a lot of hype about this place and although it is a good time, it is not very different than any of the other pool parties in Vegas, but with a lot more expense.\\n\\nOne piece of advice though, DO NOT OPEN A BAR TAB ESPECIALLY IN THE CABANA BOTTLE SERVICE AREA.  They will over charge you for drinks that you either did not order or that are different than the posted menu rates at the venue and shown on their website.  This is how the waitresses make their money.  Do not tip before you get the bill.  They will add it to your bill anyways and deny the cash you forked over earlier in the day. If you dispute the charges, they will threaten to arrest you with Vegas PD at the premises.  You do not need this kind of argument at the end of what you thought was an enjoyable day.

Patricia and Ms. Meyer had all of the information needed to prove I made the purchase, but insisted that I return to the high roller lineup and ask for a copy of my receipt. Why should I agree to spend another 15 minutes in line when I provided all the information needed to prove I purchased the high roller tickets? I had already told the Total Rewards employees, Patricia and Ms. Meyer, that high roller did not give me a receipt at the time of purchase, other than the actual tickets which already have the purchase price and date and time printed on them.

The total $26.21, that was for four people and basic meals. Here is something to remember the cost of the bacon cheese burger and fries cost only .30 less that the combo. In the case that a combo saves money, here it does. Make sure that you ask for drink carriers and napkins because if you don't ask your will not receive. \\nThe fries have a seasoning on them and they are a little crunchy, they don't offer any fry sauce, the hamburgers are small in comparison with the quarter pounders, however they taste pretty good. The milk shake I had was vanilla and it taste good and wasn't over powering. Our children didn't complain about their food and my wife likes the fries.

It's like every Le Peep was built in the 80s and hasn't changed a thing since.  Their menu items for brunch are pretty good, but the atmosphere kills it for me.

If this is their best salad, then I surely don't want to try the others.

We went to a 9:45 show on Saturday night, other than one large group of young adults, the crowd was obviously filled with a few parents and relatives of the performers (where I'm assuming all these 5 star ratings are from). The venue itself is pretty nice, very clean and nicely decorated. The poor young lady at the front desk was a little slow and couldn't really understand how the payment system worked, but you can let stuff like that pass because we were in no hurry. We then grabbed a beer and some candy, which was a nice addition had the show been any good. On that point, the selection of beer was pretty good. They had some nice local ones and your obvious pbr and coronas. My female friend wanted some wine but they had run out during the 7:45 show, the first red flag. Was the earlier show so bad that there was a run on all the wine? Did they make a run on the empty bottles to throw at the stage? Lord only knows, but we were about to fall down the pathetic rabbit hole and went to find our seats. The show started with warnings about using any bad language and them putting a bag on your head (confusing), for a late night show it felt very Draconian (let it slide). There is also the explanation of the silly point system that seems to matter very little to anyone(more confused). Now the \\\"\"performances\\\"\" were all disjointed, mostly mumbles and the only laughs were coming from the \\\"\"team mates\\\"\" on the stage. That is an awful way to watch a show. They would take suggestions from the audience but decided to go with some ridiculous obviously juvenile suggestions. You can't start a fire with Teddy Roosevelt as your fuel, uggggghhh YOU JUST CAN'T! Now after 30 min or so of some more awkward bumbling around the stage they decided to pick on a poor girl who was having a birthday party. Then for the next 30 min they called her husband fat, alluded to the fact that she was an alcoholic and suggested that her children were mentally handicapped. This took the show from wanting to be a family friendly experience (their words not mine) to a bad impression of Howard Stern trying to berate the audience member. This is just in bad taste and frankly just Awful!!! The funniest part of the night was a twitter feed had been set up to make fun of the performers, pretty hilarious. It's a very bad sign when at least half of the audience is on the Internet trying to find something funnier. The whole experience made me cringe for days. 5 days later I'm still fuming over the whole thing.

I ordered a pizza with olives and whatever great divide beer they had on draft. Their beer mark-up is much higher than industry standard. After 20 minutes, my pizza came out with the incorrect toppings. After 20 more minutes, it came out correctly. It was fine, but by that time I just wanted to get my shit and leave. One of the staff had put on some truly awful music on the jukebox, and the noise from trying to mount that TV behind the bar was distracting.\\n\\nAs a server, I know that in this type of situation, it's standard to offer the customer some kind of discount, or to take care of the customer's drinks so that they come back (or at the very least, to avoid a negative review).

But the food is average, quite often cold (as calling the client names is very inefficient) and the food is far away from the supposedly organic/healthy image this place has.", "I really don't like giving lower star ratings, but wow...sometimes it just can't be helped.  Pasta Cucina here at the Texas Station was in a word, underwhelming.  After being seated I just wasn't even close to impressed.  I should have known something was up because on a Friday night the place was near empty, with maybe only 4-5 tables being occupied at the time.  Spider-Sense failed me!\\n\\nThe place was set nicely with great ambience and warmth.  But none of this was used to the restaurant's advantage.  After being seated by the friendly manager we proceeded to wait...and wait.  My lady and I did hear some light arguing in the back of the house involving why the couple that just came in (us) was seated at our particular table.  Seems our waiter was hoping it would stay empty until closing so he could promptly leave right when the restaurant closed.  I being a good sport disregarded hearing this to try and give him a chance.  I know the feeling of wanting to go home after a long day at work.  We waited for nearly 20 minutes before our waiter came out to greet us, with me pretending we didn't hear him talking about us prior.  He gave us a wine list (which was average at best) but we passed on it and asked for an ice water and iced tea.  Again, we waited.  About 15 minutes later we received our drinks and the menus.  Strike one!\\n\\nThe real reason we decided to try here was because Station Casinos was touting Pasta Cucina's 2 for $20 menu, with 11 entrees to choose from.  I would have never gone to this place otherwise to give it a shot.  So call me surprised when we receive our menus there is no 2 for $20 option to be found.   I inquire about this and I get a look from the waiter as if I'm a cheapskate.  I am, but there's no need to be rude to me!  Our waiter takes the regular menus from us and replaces them with a smaller one that has the 2 for $20 entree specials on it.  Funny thing is that because the entrees were on the cheaper side we wanted to order something from the appetizer section of the regular menu to treat ourselves.  Our waiter didn't even bother asking if we still wanted to see the regular menu.  The smart thing to do would have been to bring out BOTH the regular and 2 for $20 menu and let us choose.  This guy thought we were foolish and wouldn't even know they were running specials.  Hello!  There is a big billboard plastered right outside the casino's property!  Strike two!\\n\\nThe last straw for me was the food itself...so bland and boring!  No inspiration with the cooking.  I could have cooked this same exact food myself at home!  No joke!  Our 2 for $20 menu entrees came with soup or salad and breadsticks as a starter.  The breadsticks were a bit of a joke, warm but very reminiscent of those from that 'Olive' place.  Same shape too!  Forgettable for sure.  Pasta Cucina's house salad though was horrendous.  The other unnamed 'Italian' place had a much better salad!  Veggies were on the limp side and the dressing was watered down with not much pop.  Sad.\\n\\nOur entrees didn't fare much better.  I had the porcetta pizza with mushrooms and artichoke hearts.  The crust was cracker thin which was nice and crispy, but the toppings were scarce and overdone from sitting under the oven or the heat lamp too long.  Seriously, the small sprinking of toppings didn't give me much to go on, and the sauce and cheese were lacking in flavor and quantity.  A real let down.  My lady's chicken parmesan fared a little better but barely.  The portion of food was much more acceptable, with two large chicken breasts, and a good serving of spaghetti and marinara.  The spaghetti was okay but could have used more sauce and some salt and fresh herbs.  The chicken parmesan itself was unimpressive since it really tasted like it came frozen instead of made fresh.  The breading was soggy in some parts and actually nearly blackened in a couple spots along the edges from overcooking.  I couldn't get past this because really, who likes burnt breading?  Covering it with sauce and some cheese doesn't make the burnt taste go away.  I flipped the chicken over to check and sure enough, over dark edges.  This was strike three for me!  We were out of there ASAP.\\n\\nOur waiter didn't bother keeping our drinks refilled, I had to ask him after they were sitting empty to fill them back up.  We had quite a bit of leftovers from both entrees and asked for some to go boxes.  Our waiter proceeded to take our food to the back and pack them up.  At this point I was totally turned off from Pasta Cucina and just wanted to get out of there.  I paid and even though I had some lackluster service from our waiter, I left him a 20% tip anyway.  I take our leftover box and drive home.  An hour later I'm hungry again.  I open up the box and guess what?!  Our lovely waiter only packed up my leftover bland A$$ pizza!  No leftover chicken parmesan!  Pasta Cucina is a B-U-M-M-E-R.  Avoid!", "I am writing this from the Flamingo and I have two rooms.   The water is off, and it is supposed to come on at 6 AM.

Went down to the lobby, and all i got was two tiny bottles of water.  No offer of anything whatsoever.  Also, the lamp in my daughter's room has no plug, so they are in semi darkness.

Although there did appear to be a lot of cooked items, the quality of the food was enough to make us contemplate coming here again last week.\\n\\nWe arrived with a friend for some good eats but were disappointed on many levels.\\n\\nFirst of all, the service is highly lacking. Our waitress had the annoying habit of always trying to get us to order more expensive items on the menu.

No, we don't want any of your appetizers.\\n\\nAfter we kept politely declining her suggestions, she pretty much ignored us until she wanted to us to clear the bill.

Although beautifully presented, the fish texturally, lack the firmness of really fresh product. The size of the fish on the nigri was also on the thinner side. Although the seasoning of the various fish was varied, the pairing of flavors were only okay in my books. Nothing terribly innovative. And for 7 pieces of nigri, it is very expensive.\\n\\nThe sashimi special combination (sashimi plate, bowl of rice, miso soup) for $29.95 is also very expensive for what it was. The thin slices, the small portion size left me very disappointed.

There isn't much space between tables. I played it safe and ordered a plate of salmon nigiri. I noticed there wasn't a large selection of raw fish. We ordered the peach soju and the spicy tuna tempura off the happy hour menu. I thought I would be getting a peach soju that's of a thicker substance, but it ended up being soju mixed with some peach sweetener that killed the alcohol. Maybe it was my mistake of ordering soju at a sushi joint. The spicy tuna tempura was a spicy tempura roll deep fried in tempura batter and then sauces drizzled all over each piece that was cut. I couldn't taste any kind of kick from the roll.

Fine, whatever, I fully expected to get the wrong dish.\\n\\nWhen she did bring out my food, it was the correct dish but I thought there still had to be a mistake.  It was the size of a side order of rice at any other Japanese restaurant.  There was almost no pork, no egg, and no onion on it.  Considering Katsu Donburi is pork, egg, and onion on rice, this is completely unacceptable.  After I finally found the all of 3oz of pork, one egg (maybe) worth of egg, and couple of slivers of onion under the mound of seaweed flakes, I decided to see how it tasted.  It tasted like nothing.  It tasted like the soy sauce I poured over it and not much else.  I did notice a textural oddity and realized that they had put white button mushrooms in the dish.  It's not a standard ingredient in the dish and there's no need for cheap, tasteless filler in a RICE dish.\\n\\nThe worst part of the entire thing was getting the check and finding out this pathetic, tasteless, side dish they had the gall to call an entree was $15.\\n\\nThere are so many good Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas that it is a shock to me that people still eat here.", "Worst Customer service!!!! was not happy at all will not come back.", "Yuck!

After many phone calls they decided to charge my card over the phone. I was told I would need to pay $100 cash and the remainder would be put on the card. Well come to find out they charged the total amount to my card and now I'm out $100 cash. The driver basically lied his way into a $100 dollar tip. I would have tipped him but after this evening even he knew he wasn't going to see $100 tip. So he decided to just take it upon himself to steal it from me instead. I would not recommend nor will I use this company again.", "2 times I have eaten here since new managment and both times I ended up with Food Poisoning.   I spoke to the manager and she was not very concerned.

So... if we had been rude and unfriendly we could have been charged less.  How annoying!", "Granted, the restaurant selection in Chandler is slim and pretty generic. And the Ocotillo district, though it aspires to become \\\"\"the next Scottsdale,\\\"\" has a way to go....the area billed as \\\"\"downtown Ocotillo\\\"\" is, in reality, just a mid-sized strip mall.\\n\\nSo by those standards, The Egg and I is pretty decent....the food's not bad and the portions are generous.\\n\\nBut the service...I can sugar-coat it if you like, but in a nutshell, it just plain sucks. \\n\\nI arrive with my wife and kids, we have four people ahead of us on the list, and we're told 10-15 minutes...not bad for a Sunday morning. Never mind that we can see four tables, all clean and available...we wait patiently, and after 15 our hostess leads us past two empty booths and three empty tables to a table in the back, with rickety chairs, by the kitchen entrance, and within sniffing distance of the rest rooms. We ask if we can have a booth instead, and are told they're reserved. \\n\\nMeanwhile, two groups of four who arrived after us get seated right away, and are being brought their drinks while we're still waiting for any one of six, count 'em, six waitresses to even look at us. Waitresses are running past us every 30 seconds (like I said...we're right in front of the kitchen), and every one of them actually avoids my eye contact....as do the three waitresses standing gabbing with their customers. (I'm not talking about taking their orders...I'm talking about \\\"\"how did you like the movie,\\\"\" and \\\"\"my brother's playing football this weekend\\\"\" kind of gabbing.) If the place was slow, I could see it...but when you've got customers sitting there being ignored, that's just rude.\\n\\nAfter 10 minutes of this I get up and go to the front and ask the manager why. She smiles sweetly and tells me their reserved customers get preference in seating. I ask if they also get preference in service and civility....I get a blank look. Either she's considering the question carefully, or she's trying to figure out what \\\"\"civility\\\"\" means. \\n\\nIn the end, she sends us a waitress. The food was actually not bad...not worth the extra 15 minutes between sitting down and ordering it, but not bad. And she knocked a bit off the check to make up for it, which I wasn't counting on....a smart practice for any restaurant that wants to see a disgruntled customer return. That said, my wife was even more annoyed than I was, and I doubt we'll be returning any time soon.", "Recently changed ownership, but kept the name.  Owned now by a couple that runs a couple other froyo places and I honestly like the new place less.  Before it was nice and having the owner working there most of the time was a nice sight, but when I went in this time the music was blaring and a fan was blowing so that the kid behind the counter had to ask us what we said multiple times.  The new owners said they were going to bring a little bit of their own flare to the business, but all they brought was new chairs, louder music, and non-fresh froyo (Yes thats right they have some flavors pre-made and sitting in the fridge instead of making it fresh from the machine.)  Disappointing.", "It's been a couple of weeks since I stayed here, I just haven't had the time to post a review.  I do feel that it needs to be done.  My husband & I go to Vegas at least five times a year.  We really enjoy it there and like to stay at a different hotel each time, but usually remain pretty loyal to MGM-Mirage resorts.  \\n\\nAugust was a pretty busy month for us work-wise & we were pretty burned out...we needed a vacation!  I received an email from Sears Vacations with a special Vegas offer.  What timing!  We decided to make a quick getaway to unwind.  There was a choice of three hotel specials, the most expensive of which was Mandalay Bay.  Well, we have always wanted to stay there and decided to make the plunge & book it.\\n\\nWe left early on Friday, Aug 24th to beat the check in crowd.  We arrived there around 12pm and the lobby  was PACKED!  There had to be over 100 people in line to check in.  There were only four windows open to handle this crowd.  They actually rolled a beverage cart to the lobby and were selling beer to people as they waited in line.  I couldn't help but think that maybe they ought to pull the beer guy off and put him behind the counter.  We waited 45 minutes to check in.  When finally reached the counter we were offered a \\\"\"room upgrade\\\"\" for $30.  I asked if she had a view suite and was told yes, so we decided to go for it.\\n\\nWe got to our room & the 1st room key didn't work.  We messed with the 2nd one a few times & finally got the door open.  Our \\\"\"View Suite\\\"\" only had half a window...with a view of the roof!  We didn't want to wait in that line again-just wanted to get to the pool so we decided to deal with it & unpacked.  At first glance, the room looked pretty nice.  I changed into my bathing suit and walked barefoot across the carpet.  It was damp & sticky!  I grabbed my flip flops and began to notice that the whole carpet was stained & spotted, with \\\"\"traffic marks\\\"\" everywhere.  The sofa was stained & dirty as well.  There was hair stuck in the bedspread, and dust and trash all around the platform bed.  The clock radio/ipod dock didn't work, the jacuzzi had broken jets, and the ice machine was broken on my floor. \\n\\nLong story short, we were terribly disappointed with our stay.  This hotel needs some TLC, and for the prices they charge it's NOT worth it.   I did call the Front Desk Manager upon check out and she did credit us our \\\"\"Resort Fee\\\"\" and the room upgrade, but I still have the $462 bill to pay Sears for the original booking...I could have stayed twice as long at another hotel.", "I brought my cat there today to be shaved. I made the apt for 1:30. When I got there I was told that the woman who was supposed to groom my cat was across the way getting her hair colored. Originally I was told I would just wait for my cat, but now that the groomer was getting her hair colored, I had to leave my cat there until 3:00.\\n\\nNow let me preface that my cat does not like to be groomed, to be fair. BUT when I got there, 2 other gals had my cat pinned down. My cats nail was bleeding because it was cut too short, and she had 3 other cuts on her. The groomer was yelling at my cat to \\\"\"CUT IT OUT\\\"\" because she was trying to get loose. Well, anyone that knows cats would know yelling at them is pointless and only upsets them more.\\n\\nMy cat then got very upset and peed on herself. My cat scratched or bit the groomer and she threw my cat in her cage, with one leg not even shaved, and said they were done. The groomer said she had to leave to get her hair color rinsed off (oh ya, I forgot to say all this was going on with the groomer having hair color on).\\n\\nWhen I dropped her off, I left specific instruction NOT to cut her face hair. I don't like how it looks like a pom-pom, but she did cut it that way. The other gal that works there said she had told her not to do it and she did it anyway.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I will not bring my cat there again, I will bring her somewhere else to get her last leg shaved.

There have been multiple days when I would get skipped over in the line formed up to hand over the keytag for every person more attractive than me, or just stand around waiting while the staff member was hitting on someone.  Another classic \\\"\"urban active\\\"\" moment was when I was waiting in line at the juice bar for 5 minutes after a workout waiting for a smoothie, while a meathead staff member leaned against the wall with his back to me texting.  His manager came out and said meathead would be right with me.  Meathead turned around, looked at me, laughed at me, and went back to texting.  I did not receive a smoothie.  \\n\\nThe attitude of every person that works there is definitely \\\"\"lol you signed a contract screw you.\\\"\"  It's way too expensive to put up with that bullshit.", "Kiddi got Bananas Foster Crepe & I got the Rebel Special..yummmmmm!Two stars b/c they only have sweet fillings & the crepe itself falls apart.", "A group of 7 families decided to book a family stay-cation for the Fourth of July at the Marriott Tempe Buttes for the first time.  The property is beautiful and well maintained, the check in staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool attendant Krystina was the absolute best. However- we did have some very serious service related issues with our stay: 1.  The main reason for staying at the Buttes was to spend the day at the pool so the kids could play on the water slide.  By the end of the day the little ones all looked like they had been used as whipping posts from the bruises and scrapes left from a too-dry water slide. ALL of the kids had multiple bruises and scrapes on their little backsides and backs.  That is unacceptable! A total safety issue that needs to be rectified.  2. Prior to arrival, we had checked with the front desk to clear snacks and water bottles at the pool.  Once given the go-ahead we pack the standard: water bottles, goldfish, popcorn, etc. Upon entering the pool our bags were searched for alcohol.  Anytime the pool manager walked by our area, our bags were searched again.  This happened SEVERAL times.  I can see searching once for due diligence- but after the second or third round- it was frustrating, humiliating and embarrassing. We didn't even stay pool side long enough to watch the fireworks from the pool due to the whole situation. Spent $145/night to sit in the hotel room.  3. Although I love a good party, and can not fault the staff for noise levels of guests due to celebration, it took 3 calls from 11pm-3am for staff to finally knock on neighbors door and insist on quiet.  Definitely not my best hotel experience. I honestly do not see myself going back to a Marriott property anytime soon.  Normally I will give a place a second or third chance before bashing them online, but this whole experience was incredible- in the worst possible way.", "I would never go back!  \\n\\nOur visit started with a group of bellman who ignored us when we pulled up to park our car at the valet.  We had to call out to a group of chatting bellman for help.  No sooner did the bellman start removing our bags from the trunk when someone in charge of valet parking started yelling at us to move our car.  It was unbelievable. The bellman was embarrassed but said \\\"\"this is just how they are.\\\"\"  My husband got back in the car to reposition it (and stop the yelling).  \\n\\nWe went in to the lobby and faced as line of at least 30 trying to check in.  They did not have enough people working to handle the crowd.  \\n\\nWe paid for a high end room with panoramic views.  But unlike most better hotels, the bellman did not accompany us to our room.  When we got there we could not figure out how to operate the many electric operated blinds and light switches.  Ordinarily, the bellman shows you to your room and shows you how to use its features.\\n\\nWe quickly discovered the room was poorly cleaned. There was dust on virtually every surface and a large coffee drip under the coffee maker on the counter. There were greasy fingerprints on the cabinets and TV.  There were hunks of fallen snacks just under the couch. Someone's forgotten beach shawl was in the closet.  Again, it was unbelievable.  \\n\\nWe had theatre tickets and needed to change and rush out, so we had no time to demand a new room. The next morning we needed to check out early and tried to use the advertised check out service on the TV screen, but it did not work.  The service said the front desk was too busy so we needed to check out in person.  But when my husband went downstairs, there were no guests at the front desk.  Just employees waiting around.  To top it all off, when we called from our room for the valet to bring the car around, we were told that they won't do that.  We needed to come down and wait.\\n\\nThis place holds itself out and charges high end prices, but the service is appalling and the dirty room was creepy.

Definitely a very awe-spiring show to incorporate water into their acts, but personally. this is not one of my favorite Cirque productions. \\n\\nTen years ago, I was 15, sitting smack in the middle only few rows from the stage. It was seriously the best seats I've ever gotten in a Cirque show, which already had set the tone as 'this will be my favorite'. Just a few months ago I came to Vegas with a friend who has never seen a Cirque production, so I was ecstatic on bringing him to see 'the best Cirque show in Vegas'. This time, it was so hard to stay awake, and it's not because I was drinking and partying all day (well..). Anyway the way I see it, it's like Swan Lake on actual water with some cool circus tricks. Everything just seemed really slow and boring. I don't think it portrays Cirque's unique talents, special effects, and overall production to its' highest potential. \\n\\nIf this show existed by itself, I would applaude them for everything they have accomplished creating this show. I still do think they deserve a lot of credit because none of it is easy. I just know that there are a lot of other Cirque productions that have seriously left me (O.O) walking out of the theatre, that I can't praise this one with such a high review. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this show to an older crowd looking for a romantic, elegant evening. That's how they portray this show as anyway, right?

Great place for your guy friends to bustamove with any and all girls. The most important thing to me is great music and although the DJ had some great tunes up his sleeve, he had a serious ADD problem. Every 15 seconds - literally - the song would change. You couldnt really get into any one song and forget about appearing to have rhythm b'c the beat would be changing constantly.

That was the sorriest excuse for a cupcake I have ever experienced.

I saw a friend post pictures of cupcakes on facebook and stalked until someone asked where she got them. Upon finding out, I went to look them up and convinced my husband we needed to try them.

These cupcakes are larger than necessary and I am sure loved by all those overweight, but they should have the standard size out for those of us who don't feel like eating 5 1/2 oz of cupcake in a single sitting. I ordered the strawberry cupcake because that is what I base every cake company on, and my husband ordered the fox 10 cupcake.

It is also covered in glitter, which I didn't find appealing. And why the hell is there so much of it?? I scraped off all of the frosting and just ate the cake, which was also just as bad. I didn't try my husbands cake, which was chocolate, but mine was weird and tasted a lot like kool-aid or fruit punch, or something. I have never had a strawberry cupcake taste so artificial. Oh wait, yes I have. Its called a box mix. It tasted just like it came out of a box. There were red chunks of something in my cake batter. Not sure what the hell those were. Gummies?

To me it just doesnt taste as good and there was no choice it just comes that way.  Other things were really dry and not as good as what I am used to when I go out to eat.  The iced tea was nice it was a black tea with cinnamon added so not that special but I guess it is different than the norm which I like.  To me Pita Jungle and My Big Fat Greek are far superior but of course it would depend on what you ordered.  I like spicy and I love tahini.  This place was kinda below average for me and I think its because of the dark meat chicken.  My husband left his whole plate untouched pretty much.

I love diners. I love the 50's theme and the music. But this diner is in need of help. I have been to Shari's 4-5 times since moving to Vegas from the Chicago area. Each time we've been, we find something else we don't like. So the last time we ate there was *the* last time and we won't be going back. The food is hit or miss. I've had under cooked burgers, where they put the burger back on the grill and then slapped back on the toppings and gave it back to me. Some of the toppings were gone and the burger was still under cooked. Since when don't you get a new burger cooked for you and not picked apart and then recooked? Our final time there, we noticed a huge change in the taste of the burgers. The burger itself was flavorless. Possibly frozen variety. If you are going to be a burger joint you need to have fresh ingredients and the burger needs to be seasoned. I have noticed that while driving by Shari's (on many occasions), the parking lot is usually empty. Maybe this has something to do with the change in burger taste. You cannot keep fresh ingredients around if no one is eating them. Another point that needs to be brought up is the lack of cleaning and maintenance to the restaurant. Duct taped booths are really showing wear. The floor is in great need of a power cleaning. And we find that the  tattered napkins with comments to be overly tacky. With all the other great memorobilia there, the napkins are an eye-sore. I've met the owner, Shari, and she is super nice. Same for her daughter. Shari's husband could due with cracking a smile once in a while at the customers though. The prices charged do not match the quality of the  food.

I do not write reviews normally, but the customer service is so terrible I must warn fellow yelpers.  I will try be fair in my comments here and give credit where it's due (almost no where). Came here because a coworker loves it.\\n\\nBefore we get into the owner/manager's attitude problem, let's talk about the food first. We did the AYCE menu for dinner. the fact that they offer sashimi is a plus. I will say that the basics like salmon and hamachi were ok. Soft shell crab was ok too.  But what is up with the Kama that took only three minutes to come out and has the texture of fish jerky? Also, the cajun albacore was not seared... more like half cooked to a hard texture. The uni was questionable in color for sure - almost brown. I wish I had read warnings about that, and the big ball of rice in previous reviews prior to going. We did over-order unfortunately, and my friend wanted to get all our orders of uni in one go - there were four of us. I interrupted and said let's get half for now, which would be 8 pieces.  Well, guess the server heard what my friend said but ignored what I said.  Because 16 pieces came out.  We wanted to send it back but then decided to just suck it up... what could go wrong? A LOT. \\n\\nNot all of us ate it because of the weird color.  My friend was struggling to eat it all, so he left some rice.  The server took our plates away with the rice, and warned us that because this is AYCE if we continue to leave rice, they will have to charge us. OK, point taken.  So we were good about the rest of the rice we had. But no matter.  They charged us $12 extra for the rice anyway.  And tack on 18% gratuity for our party of four. It would have been nice to be given the chance to rectify our mistake instead of just taking the plates and adding the charge. But whatever.  We did not dispute it.  We did, however, we feel compelled to let the server know that she made a mistake of bringing out 16 pieces. So we told her upon paying. All she needed to say was sorry, we misundestood each other. But instead, she decided to get defensive and said we ordered a lot of sashimi anyway (so?), she had to charge us extra for the unfinished rice from the sushi... which, btw,  we did not even bring up. Then she grabs whom I shall call crazy old bat (and I assume is the owner). \\n\\nWell, COB began to throw her arms and get all defensive about how 8 means 8 orders of two, and then got all defensive again about the extra charge. Again, we were not disputing it. Just pointing out your error. COB also turned her back to us, pointed at our credit cards in the server's hand, and told the server in this matter-of-fact tone to \\\"\"just charge them!\\\"\" then walked away without letting us finish what we had to say. What a psycho. Perhaps there was miscommunication on both our parts, but to be talked down to like that is a whole other issue I am NOT ok with. I am in the service industry and I can't imagine anyone in our company talking to a customer like that and keeping their job.  Bill came to almost $40 per person.  \\n\\nI'm giving this one star because yelp makes you give a minimum of one.

The cheapest option was to book with United, which involved flying via Montreal. Unfortunately, the Montreal-Rome leg was operated by Air Canada. \\n\\nWhen I booked the flight I was allowed to select seats on the United flight, but to do the same on Air Canada costs $15 extra so I skipped that step as it didn't seem necessary. Unfortunately it turns out if you don't do that, they'll just give away your seat. So it's not really optional. When I boarded in Houston they already knew they'd given away my seat on the second flight. Instead of telling me that so that I could try to make alternative arrangements (at that point they could have rebooked me through New York, Atlanta, London - the possibilities are endless), they flew me to Montreal for no reason, to be told on arrival that there was no seat for me and that I was on standby. \\n\\nAfter they confirmed that all the seats on the flight were gone I thought it would be straightforward to get rebooked on a different flight. Unfortunately there was nothing available until 22 hours later - that actually makes sense, since it's their policy to overbook all their flights by 20% (they freely admit to this). Still, what I wasn't expecting was that I would then have to spend 2 hours standing in line at their ticket desk to get rebooked. By the time I got to the hotel they had booked for me, the dining room had closed and it wasn't possible to spend the $15 meal voucher they had given me. On top of that, the agents on the desk seemed to be extraordinarily incompetent - the first ticket they issued me turned out not to be valid at all and when I went back to the airport the next day I had to spend another hour standing in line at the ticket desk to get that rectified.\\n\\nThe onward flight was routed through Barcelona so what should have been a 9 hour journey turned into a 14 hour journey. I eventually arrived 36 hours late - 2 hours after the wedding reception had started. I missed the entire rehearsal dinner. Nothing could compensate me for this. But what they did offer was laughable - $200 in cash or a $500 Air Canada voucher.\\n\\nI certainly won't fly with Air Canada again. What they are operating is essentially a scam - pay another fee to book your seat or we'll give it away. And the agents on the ticket desk kept telling me 'next time make sure to book your seat'.

I'll break it down by ingredient, you'll see why. \\n\\nI can't comment on the bun since I ordered it without one, but that wouldn't have affected my review. The ingredients are as follows: bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, special sauce, and fries.\\n\\nBacon: great. Cooked perfectly, tasted good. The quality of food I expected from a place like this. \\n\\nFried egg: amazing. cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. If every egg I had for the rest of my life was like this egg I would be happy. I typically order my eggs \\\"\"over medium\\\"\" and very few people ever get it right. This came out just shy of a perfect over medium (that's what I assume is the standard way, as mine and my wife's were both that way and we didn't specify any particular cooking method when ordering). While it was shy of over medium, it was perfect for a burger. \\n\\nTillamook cheddar: great. This is pretty good cheese. Back when I ate cheese by the pound this is what I would get. Good stuff. Hard to mess it up though, as it's a specific brand. I got exactly what I expected from this.\\n\\nSpecial sauce: this was basically cole slaw. It was awful. Tasted like more sugar than anything, I immediately removed it all from the burger. Hugely disappointing, and incredibly over-sweet. Was also really runny.\\n\\nFries: just absolutely awful. Easily the most disappointing part of this meal. Taste extremely cheap and low quality. Very little salt, very little flavor other than that flavor you get when you know these fries are some cheap crappy bulk freezer section bag that have been reheated and left under a warming lamp for hours. Just awful. Terrible.\\n\\nHamburger patty itself: the flavor was only okay, but it is very visually unappealing. Looks like, again, something super cheap from the freezer section of a crappy grocery store. Blatantly pre-pressed and pre-formed. However, I asked for it cooked medium and it was cooked perfectly. Seasoned well, but the meat itself can only be dressed up so much. Both visually and in flavor.\\n\\nOn the plate, there were also two kinds of \\\"\"pickles\\\"\". Definitely not my style. I tried both styles, expecting a pickle and getting something from the first that tasted more like a super-slightly-pickled cucumber, and from the second that again tasted like a more-pickled-but-covered-in-sugar cucumber. They were both very not good. I was able to eat the first, but I had to immediately spit out the second. Totally gross. I don't understand why the sugar featured so prominently, cucumbers are sweet on their own and pickles are not. These were not a good combination of flavors.\\n\\nIt's kind of sad to write this review, as the burger's flavor combination with the egg and the bacon and cheese really went well together, but the cheapness of the patty and the extremely disappointing fries make me suspect the quality of all the ingredients. The food is all cooked perfectly. Somebody in the kitchen obviously knows exactly what they're doing. The egg and bacon and patty were all expertly executed. What they don't understand is that quality ingredients are important, apparently. I will not be back here any time soon.", "I think this store is closed.

This is all thanks to my favorite nail tech Thao who does wonderful, creative and professional work.  My nails (for now) are all over their Instagram page-- we made beautiful music together!  This has all been IN SPITE of Jimmy, the proprietor who also works on nails.  He is rude, pompous and generally all around unprofessional by my observation.  Today (Friday) I arrived at the salon at 2:30 pm for a mani/pedi.  I walked in ahead of, and signed in before three other people, and we were all seated at the same time.  One of those ladies was seated right next to me.  The service was going as usual, with one of the nail techs getting my water started and soaking my gel nails for removal.  THIRTY MINUTES LATER, I am still sitting with my toes wrapped in foil, soaking in PURE ACETONE.  The tech that started working on removing my gels, which should take about 10 minutes max, had been moved off of me to start working on the woman that came in behind me.  This woman was now more than half way through her pedi at this point.  Nobody has said a WORD to me this whole time.  Having had enough of this stuff sitting on my feet, I reached down to inspect my toes, which were now shriveled and white.  The tech working on a person beside me took notice, and I told her that it had now been 30 minutes that I had been soaking.  JIMMY the proprietor who was SITTING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME, speaks to her in Vietnamese, and she answers.  Jimmy then calls to the young woman who mans the front desk and says, \\\"\"She wants to leave-- take her foil off and seat [name unheard] in four.\\\"\"  I was sitting in the 4th chair from the back.  He never ONCE addressed me.  Now, he is usually rude, and I'm not sure why the owner behaves this way, as I have stated before that I have spent LOTS of money here over the past year without incident.  I have a great relationship with my regular nail tech.  I just got up out of the chair and walked out NEVER TO RETURN AGAIN.  A gel mani with nail art usually runs me around $40 there, every two weeks.  A Rockstar pedi is $55.

Due to the fact that everyone seems to love the food, I keep trying new things but am usually sorely disappointed.

All of the tiles in the pool area could use a thorough powerspray or replacement. The sauna has the glass brick window/walls that are cracked and broken.

I normally bring my items unwrapped and have the store box and ship the items. Depending on where these items go, the price normally ranges between $40-$60. When I was sick, I asked my wife to take the same items and ship them with a directions on what I needed done. The owner proceed to wrap and ship the items in huge boxes ( way larger than they needed to be) and charged my wife $126 for the same items I normally have them box and ship for half the price.  When she asked him why it was so expensive he told he that they didn't have a smaller box and that was all he could do. When I confronted him the following day Ian's sacked why he would take advantage of my wife, he responded and told me and my wife (her standing next to me) that my wife must be lying and he only package the item the way she requested. I now drive twice the distance to the Dysart Rd. FedEx store for shipping.", "I am in Vegas every year for Valentine's Day. This year my gift to my guy was a first golf lesson for both of us. I did research on golf courses in the area and settled on Callaway after receiving a personal recommendation from a friend who had been. I hired the course's golf pro for 1.5 hours. We took a cab from the Wynn (Why didn't we use their greens? Don't know!) and we arrived early. I checked in at the front desk and was told that the pro was waiting for us. I was instructed to \\\"\" look for the white man with dark brown hair\\\"\". Yes, really. At a golf course I was sent to look for a white man. That was literally everyone there except for me, her and my boyfriend. So, after one unsuccessful lap around looking for the pro, I returned to the desk to get more specific instructions. We did finally find him and our lesson commenced. He was a great guy and I am happy that he gave us our first lesson. I was only bothered that during our lesson he put his hand on my head (part of the lesson) to hold it down without asking permission. It was my first lesson, so perhaps this is normal? I did not like it either way. However, the lesson was enjoyable and he was a gem. The grounds seemed nice enough, but once I returned to the Wynn and had brunch on their golf course it became very clear that not all golf courses are the same.", "I have never been a fan of ulta, but my wife likes nice things, so we decided to come here instead of sephora because it is closer.

I had a pedicure with my friend and it was nice, good experience. The only reason why I am giving PN's two stars is when I went back to get gels done on my finger nails they did it all wrong and they started chipping the next day and peeling off within 3-4 days. It was awful. I've had gels on my nails plenty time to know that they last awhile but sadly they peeled off within the week. Sigh. I probably will not go back and stick with the original place I go to.\\n\\nAlso, another thing that bothers me is when they ask you to pay before your visit is over and they COUNT their tip right in front of you, it's so awkward. I tip 20% on the visits and I feel like they want to make sure they are making money, which I understand but right in front of you? Awkward.", "Maybe I just had bad luck but this place was awful. I mean awful. I have a horrible rash that looks similar to \\\"\"heat hives\\\"\" and did a ton of research on my own before actually seeing a doctor.

So, one hour later I enter into my room and then proceeded to wait another 20 minutes for the actual doctor to arrive. Upon arrival the doctor was a little too friendly. He asked to look at my back, due to the rash, and the proceeded to pull out my shorts and look down my pants WITHOUT permission. I think a simple question about where my hives were would have sufficed over a visual answer without consent. Several moments later he continued looking all over my skin to then only tell me he did not know what it was or what caused it. Instead, he told me I had \\\"\"Red Punctis,\\\"\" which is the literal translation for red dots in latin. WOW.

It's an ok place, but with 4 Peaks just on the other side of the parking lot we usually tend to pass on this place. \\n\\nWe went yesterday and it was a disappointment. We got there before they started charging a cover (at 4 pm) otherwise it would have been $10 to get in. I'm guessing that this was to pay for the limited tables, chairs and one tent they rented. Also the band who was singing \\\"\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\\"\" and something else by Snow Patrol. Also they were charging $6 for drinks. It was just a little ridiculous. It was pretty much imposable to get drinks or food inside, which those of us who have tried their food before, weren't big fans of anyway.

We were seeking a decently priced burger that wasn't far from us so we used Yelp to help us break down some choices. The pictures and decent reviews made Burger Brothers the place to go. Confused at first by the hole in the wall location attached to a gas station I expected more than I should have. When we walked in the employee did not seem like he enjoyed working there. I order my cheese burger with an add on of mushrooms and egg that came out to a decent price.  The paying at the gas station did throw me off but I just went with it expecting an amazing burger. When my order was ready he let me know that he didn't have any eggs and \\\"\"not charge me for it.\\\"\" I went back to the gas station employee to ask for my original ticket receipt that shows the items on my burger and proved to the Burger Brothers employee he did charge me. From that point he got defensive with me and gave an attitude while saying I gave you guys the large soda cup instead of the regular because I knew we didn't have eggs. Are you kidding me!! I never asked for an ultimatum for the mistake he made. He knew he didn't have eggs and he didn't take the time out of his only three orders to tell us. The burger was decent but did not have all the ingredients on the menu even on the burger.  The fries were definitely well done with most of them with the skin still on. Overall taste of the burger was ok, but the service that employee gave was the worst customer service I've ever gotten. I don't write reviews  but the way I felt after leaving this burger spot definitely deserved my two cents. If I had the opportunity to get my money back I would take it in a heartbeat.

Unfortunately, my trio of friends waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and things didn't improve from there.  The food was fine, but pricey for what we got IMO.  Round Corner Cantina does it better and cheaper...again, IMO.  \\n\\nThis second visit was more of the same. Again we waited for our drinks, which this time were just a pair of Diet Cokes and a water, so no complicated mortar and pestle business there.  My two buds ordered the same dinner - grilled chicken tacos and I had the Pollo En Mole Poblano or, Big Ass Piece of Chicken, for short.  Again, the food was totally fine.  Their tacos were fine tacos and my chicken was fine chicken, though pretty bland.  The best and most surprising part of the menu was the Mango Iced Tea, which we only discovered due to an unexpected shortage of Diet Coke (true story).  \\n\\nI want to like Verde.

Without validation our parking fee would have been $13.00 - this is unheard of elsewhere in Vegas where there is totally free parking and often free valet (Signature Hotel) in every one of the major hotels on the strip - but with validation the parking fee at the Four Queens was $1.00. Here is the scam: When we handed the parking attendant our ticket, he looked at the ticket and clearly, loudly and quite distinctly said, \\\"\"$5.00!\\\"\" We were reaching for the fee when we saw that the electronic read-out on front of his booth said $1.00 in large red numbers. So we said, which is it $1.00 or $5.00? and he then said, \\\"\"Pay this\\\"\" pointing at the illuminated sign that read $1.00 in large red numbers. You know as well as I do that MANY people - especially foreigners and the elderly hear $5.00 and they pay $5.00 no matter what the numbers on the booth might show.

(Gotta be on your toes in Las Vegas - there are thieves and pickpockets everywhere.)", "What happened to the cinnamon rolls?!?! \\nThis afternoon, I had one for the first time since Dozen came under new ownership and it was a mere shadow of their amazing original. The dough was heavy, dry and nearly flavorless (it tasted much like the inside of an unsalted soft pretzel).  The outside of the roll was extremely pale and almost chalky colored, like it had been dusted with flour.  Most disappointing was that instead of the classic pinwheel of gooey, spicy cinnamon throughout, there was only an odd little pattern, which was very mildly flavored and dry.    The only thing that remained the same was the icing (tangy and plentiful) and the size (huge).  \\nI used to be tempted to eat myself sick on these, but this time I barely made it through half (I kept waiting for it to get better).  Bottom line: this is NOT the Best Cinnamon Roll of Dozen's heyday, and that's a real bummer.\\n It's not even worth it to get into our mediocre brunch entrees.  I'll just get more depressed. Dozen as we knew it is pretty much gone and that's that.  I haz a sad :(", "So...this is a hard review for me. I just had amazing Chinese food this past week....maybe New York is different? \\n\\nI ordered delivery. He told me 45 mins, which I hoped was like pizza and really showed up in 20. Nope, 45 mins exact almost. \\n\\nThe food was packaged nicely, and was warm. \\n\\nIt was a little soggy...which I understand cause it is delivery....but you can get Panda, drive 45 mins, and it still is crispy. \\n\\nI got the orange chicken, and the flavor was good. Some times I had that....\\\"\"what am I eating\\\"\" moment. Especially with the egg roll. I am not sure what that was.

Too many times I've given up on finding help after walking around the place, and have just walked out.

That's your selling point opportunity...", "This is located inside Christown Spectrum Mall. I was not impressed by the food or service.\\n\\nThere aren't many eating options inside this particular mall. Around the mall are a Mandarin Buffet, Taco Bell/Pizza Hut and a Carl's JR. There is a McDonalds inside the Walmart near the mall. I was inside the mall and wanted a quick bite to eat. I had never eaten here and they had standard chinese food like eggrolls, rice, and more.\\n\\nI stood outside for a moment to read the menu since the place is so small. Upon entering, I was asked by a man what my order was and I ordered beef and broccoli and 3 egg rolls. The menu board said the beef and brocoli came with rice but the man asked me which size I wanted and held up two containers. I chose the bigger container. He quickly packed up my order and gave it to the girl at the register. I noticed that he only packed up the beef and broccoli and the egg rolls but before I could say anything, the girl at the register was asking for the money. She held her hand out and didn't even tell me the amount. The beef and broccoli with the rice costs about $6 and I was only charged $3. The man clearly got my order wrong but I don't see how. Before I could correct the order, the girl kind of shook her open palm at me, motioning for me to give her the money. I gave it to her, she gave me my change and kind of shoved the bag at me while saying \\\"\"here\\\"\" and walked off to the back. Unacceptable rudeness.\\n\\nThe eggrolls were nasty and they MUST have gotten the rolls from the frozen section at the Walmart next door. The beef and broccoli was alright.\\n\\nWith this experience, I will not be returning and I would not recommend this place.

On it's way out.", "I've really been wanting to stop by City Athletic for a few months because we recently moved and I've been looking for a new gym. I had been trying to convince my hubby why it would be worth it to spend the extra $$ on a nicer gym, but I have to say we were both pretty underwhelmed by CAC. First off, the gym is SO dark. I'd read that in some of the reviews, but I had hoped it was people just being haters. I suppose maybe the members get used to it? IDK, but I like  at least half-way decent lighting when I work out... I'm not trying to take a nap you know? Secondly, the pool is unavailable for use every weekday between 3-8pm. So, if you're like my husband who can only work out in the afternoons... no pool usage for you except on weekends. Ironically, the only hours during the week they have childcare is 4-8. So if you're a Mom and want to work out in the morning... or want to swim in the afternoon, you're screwed there too. Considering how many personal trainers and fitness/figure competitors I know work out here, I was actually shocked to learn they only have one squat rack? Really? I think there were two smith machines, but only one squat rack? That one blew me away. The locker rooms were decent, not as impressive as in the photos. Plenty spacious and showers looked clean, so did the pool and steam room/sauna. Pool was a little warm, but I know a lot of people like it like that.  So all in all, I guess I could see the appeal, it is larger than your typical strip mall gym... but I personally couldn't find one reason to justify spending $50-60 per person for use of their normal facilities. I guess I could see the appeal for the people who want to spend more for the crossfit/kickboxing  or MMA classes. I do love that they offer non-contract membership, I think all gyms should be that way and it's refreshing to see. If they added morning childcare, did something about the lighting and opened up the pools even just a few days a week in the afternoon - I would absolutely reconsider joining CAC.", "Wie mein Vorg\\u00e4nger zu der positiven Bewertung kommt ist mir echt ein R\\u00e4tsel.

But my shellac manicure from her was probably the worst manicures I've ever received. I don't know if she did a bad job because I had an Amazon Local deal and she just rushed me out. For one she cut my cuticles dry, the shellac is bubbly and uneven, there's polish on my leftover untrim cuticles, and she didn't even shape my nails when she filed. In the end, I will never ever come back.", "Mill Pointe Apartments has merged with the 201 West property next door and they are now known as Huntington Apartment Homes. There is also new management under Allison-Shelton. This change took place in April 2014 so I understand that there are still some issues to work out with management and organization (and some residents are not happy about this change), but I am still glad that I took a chance and decided to move when my lease ended this summer.\\n\\nAfter apartment searching again in Tempe, I wanted to update this review after seeing what else is out there. For this price range, I would say that this is a good deal because of the amount of space and location. The quality of the apartment is comparable to what you would find in other complexes at this price range (no real wooden floors, surfaces for countertops, somewhat rough carpet), although Mill Pointe seems to be older and it shows in the quality of the flooring, bathroom, etc. One great thing that I did not mention before was that I did not have any insect issues at all, and that the complex overall is very quiet.\\n\\nManagement still has a lot of room for improvement and I hope this will get better as it has been a few months since the transition/merger. It is still difficult to reach the office by phone. None of the staff have an individual email address; rather there is one single address for the whole property that you use, and they will direct it to the appropriate person (rather inconvenient when you already know who you want to contact), and even then you may not receive a reply. Often the staff in the leasing office don't seem to know what's going on either. Work orders, even important ones, may require a few follow-ups (although my last request was completed within 24 hours which was the fastest response I had ever seen!).\\n\\nOverall, I was mostly satisfied with my living experience here as a first apartment on my own. However If you can afford to increase your own price range by even just $50/month for rent, I would recommend looking elsewhere. You can settle for the quality of the apartment, but it is really the management that will frustrate you when living here.", "Our server was amazing, but the food was absolutely horrible. I do not recommend this to anyone", "I'm a bit of a hotel snob- Ive stayed over 90 days in Starwood properties over the past year. So when i go to a property in the luxury collection I have high expectations. I expect St Regis / ritz kind of luxury and service. This property didn't deliver and neither did the staff.  It was ordinary, which, in the luxury collection, just doesn't cut it. \\nI should have stayed it the aloft which is just down the street. I'm confident that they would have exceeded my more modest expectations.", "Its okay overall, a little pricey compared to Jewelry and Mineral though.

Won't go there again !", "I do not recommend this gym. Like Jack C., I too was charged an annual fee that I was never told about. When I joined the gym, I worked nearby so it was convenient. When I changed jobs, it was too far for me to travel. I was told that I would still have to come in to cancel my membership, I could not do it by phone. VERY inconvenient. When I did go in to cancel, they charged me a $25 fee that I was also never told about. They also charged me my monthly dues two days AFTER charging me the cancellation fee. I think that the reason they only charge $10 a month is because they have all these hidden fees that they don't warn you about. If you are looking into joining, make sure you ask about ALL extra fees they will be charging you. I will never go back to You Fit.", "Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.\\n\\nWe came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). \\n\\nAnyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.\\n\\nIt had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \\\"\"Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\\\"\" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). \\n\\nHmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.\\n\\nI dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.", "We arrived to pick up our vehicle having a reservation.  Despite the line not being particularly long they took forever.  Everything they tried to sell to my husband he declined.  Despite that we turned in the car being charged $337.77 for 3 days for a Camry despite having a quote of $142.08 for a Corolla.  One of our charges was for an upgrade which they say my husband agreed to although he never did.  Another thing they did was charge us for fuel.  They told my husband it was cheaper to have them fill up the vehicle when he returned the car.  That may have been true if the vehicle was returned empty.  They charge you for a full tank of gas despite what you use.  They failed to mention that.  I'm sure it was it the small print somewhere so our mistake but consider it a warning.  They left out the important fact which is deceiving.  We returned a car with 3/4 of a full tank and were charged $54.72 for fuel.  I will not use Hertz again.", "Was excited to hear that new \\\"\"premium\\\"\" outlet stores had opened in Glendale (101 Freeway @ Glendale). We waited for the Black Friday shoppers to go home and get some sleep before venturing the 45 miles from home to check them out.  But first, I checked their website to see what their hours were, get directions, etc.  I actually thought it was considerate of them to list the Arizona Cardinals \\\"\"Game Days\\\"\" being they're located right by the University of Phoenix stadium. HOWEVER...we got there to find that THIS game day was not listed (Sun, Nov 25th)!  And guess what ~ they were charging $10 to park at the outlets, because those attending the game might park there, taking up all the free parking, and then walk over to the game. Didn't matter that we were there only for the outlet stores. But to make nice, we were given a coupon to redeem at the Service Center for a book of coupons that FAR exceeded the $10 charge to park. B...S... ~ NOT HAPPY AT ALL!  And we were later to find out we weren't the only ones! So we track down the Service Center only to find a line of people that had been waiting for 25 minutes to get their wonderful coupon book.  After scanning the coupons (of another shopper who was not happy about the parking fee), we found that the coupons were for 15% off a purchase of $100 or more, and not all stores at the outlets were represented.  Well, I wasn't impressed by the selection of stores to warrant me EVER going back there.  It takes me just about as long to go to the stores at Anthem.\\n\\nNow, I gave this whole situation some thought as I stewed about it for quite a while! First of all, I re-checked their website to make sure I didn't miss something, only to confirm that the day of our visit was not listed as a game day, nor was there anything about a $10 parking fee for that day. But then as I thought more about it, I thought, of course not!  They are not going to let people know about the fee because the shopper will not visit that day; only the people attending the game. Thus, they will be losing out on the sales revenue. And then the more I thought about, I thought, \\\"\"So, are they going to be charging people to park every time there's an event at the stadium?\\\"\" And I have to conclude the answer is YES.  So beware outlet shoppers!  It's going to be a flip of a coin whether or not you're going to have to pay for parking.  BTW...the stores there...not so premium.", "Worst pizza in the world!

Even with a map this property is impossible to navigate.  Anyhow, figured I'd grab some food and drink to go and take it back to the pool.

But...\\n\\nLet me preface this, I have only had my nails done two other times (my BFF in another state convinced me to go with her while on my vacation). I had the shellac color, then shellac tips done. I was familiar enough to know the process having had shellac done, the removal process, as well as a little research on it out of curiosity (because, wow! shellac is amazing!).\\n\\nJust over two weeks ago, I went into Enjoi because it's close and I figured I'd be trying a new place regardless so why not. I went in, was greeted and asked how she could help me, I asked if they had shellac, I was told yes, then I asked how much for shellac with the french tip. Her response was odd, \\\"\"For you? $20? Okay?\\\"\" I thought it strange, but rolled with it because the price was what I expected. So I sat down, and clarified that with the extra line, like I had already on my nails, it would only be $20. She then said $3 for the line, which was what I expected. \\n\\nShe looks at my nails, asks what I had on, shellac, and asks if I want my nails shortened so I won't have so much polish to take off, yes, and she bluntly clips them. She then pours acetone into a small bowl and has me soak my fingers in the bowl. This was NOT like my previous experience - - previously, they took a small piece of cotton put some remover on it and wrapped it in foil for 10 minutes and once it was done, they gently removed the remaining product with a cuticle pusher, careful not to scrape up my actual nail. Meanwhile, I'm soaking, she moves to the next station and does her own nails. She is going to town on filing the tops of her own nails. This SHOULD have been a sign for me to leave. No one files the tops of their nails like that. But I didn't. \\n\\nShe comes back over after a long while, sees that my shellac has almost completely lifted off, and makes a comment about how easy it's come off, shows me her nails and says \\\"\"way easier than mine!\\\"\". Then she grabs her course file and FILED THE TOPS OF MY NAILS to remove the little remaining polish. And not just a little bit of filing, a TON of filing. I knew right then and there my nails were going to be long term screwed. I should have stopped her, but I questioned myself that maybe I was wrong, that maybe she does need to file it off. Not my finest self moment. (Hindsight says my shellac came off so easily because my nails were NOT filed before painting because there is ZERO reason to do so and it still last for weeks and weeks - without nail damage)\\n\\nShe grabs a cuticle nipper and made a few small clips to a few nails then asks if I want a massage. I asked if it was extra, she said $5, I declined. She asked again, and this time I shook my head and said no thank you. She dropped it after giving me a rude look. \\n\\nNow time for the polish. I'll spare you all the details of each regular layer, but I will say that I non too quickly realized I was getting GEL and not SHELLAC. She kept messing with the UV light, changing the times and even when the light would turn off she would tell me to keep my hand in and she would restart the time. This was pretty hot. She finished but by then I am so irritated with my entire experience I wasn't really paying any attention to how my nails actually looked, just a quick glance to see that the colors were there. She then says $30. WHAT??? Why $30 now? She tells me it was for the manicure. I didn't ask for a manicure, I didn't receive a manicure, unless you count the few clips she made. I am pissed but I am not the type of person who says anything, however I have made the decision I will NOT be coming back here. She leaves me and another woman comes over to collect my money. She asks me how much, and I grudgingly say \\\"\"She told me $30.\\\"\" She asks me again, how much. Again I say $30. She then gets snippy with me and clearly says \\\"\"How much WITH TIP?\\\"\" I'm pretty sure I visibly rolled my eyes and annoyingly answered with \\\"\"$32.\\\"\"\\n\\nI left very upset. It wasn't until I got home that I really looked at my nails and realized just how awful they were. I wish I could add pictures. The lines were not uniform, there were random \\\"\"flicks\\\"\" in the lines, and most of the lines didn't even go all the way across my nails. And get this, my nails were actually jagged, I had to smooth out the ends out too. UGH. \\n\\nIn the last two weeks, I've had 2 actual nails chip.

Then my spaghetti bolognese came and it was sooooo bland way to much basil.... Like wtf are you thinking amount of basil. I  had to cover the entire thing is cheese just to get it down. PS they gave me boxed spaghetti for over $30 a plate I should be getting home made pasta. I tried the meatballs as well ...... They where ok, maybe if i grew up in ohio I might think this was a good meatball..... The only thing they had going was clearly thy had spent some time in sauce so they where tender.

We walked in and there was only one other couple there and it took about 3min for them to decide what table we were gonna sit in and who was gonna serve us. We sat down and noticed all of the dog pictures, kind of weird. The girl that was serving us never introduced herself, so have no idea what to call her. We told her this was our first time but she did not recommend anything. The cheddar fries were good and that was it. I could see the cooks in the back eating while preparing food. The staff were just standing and joking around. I only got one drink refill. It took about 15min for the server to come back and take our order. I ordered the chicken fried steak and it tasted like it came from mcdonalds and I only ate about 25% of it. My wife had the turkey and avocado sandwich and she only ate a couple of bites. She said it tasted dry and the avocado was bad.

Outdoor patio is nice with a few drinking games you can play. The food however was pretty bad. We got the humus, deviled eggs and the bacon wrapped prawns. Everything was either not seasoned or over seasoned. Prawns we're chewy and bacon was burnt. Drinks were good, reasonably priced. This place needs to think about getting a new chef though.", "Ordered chicken wings, got chicken fingers? Finally got my wings and got ten wings and one drummie?

Then another 20 minutes for them to take our order to which we never received napkins until asked. The food was awful, dry, and bland we had the carnitas, carne asada, and calamari tacos. The only thing that came out somewhat edible was the calamari. We will not be returning to this restaurant.", "This place is over-rated!

They should have some pizzas to choose from then to have us waste our time trying to decide which ingredients would be good together.  \\n\\nThe pizza was just OK...I've had better at Peter Piper's and at half the cost!  Also, we didn't want any meat on our pizza since I'm vegetarian, but there were pieces of sausage on it.  That makes you wonder about how sanitary their kitchen is.

But, I will not be going back to this location! My order was rang out wrong. I was given an attitude about them forgetting my drink. Then, my sandwich was wrong and I didn't ask them to remark it. I simple asked for the pickles they forgot. I was screamed at because my pickles would come out of the cashiers pay?! Other employees stepped in and apologized but I was already mad at that point. Went back to the table and told my husband we were leaving! The cashier sat right outside the door and took a smoke break. We had to basically climb over her to leave. Then she thought it would be a good idea to call me a b**** as we got into our truck! I'm sorry I asked for pickles I paid for & you forgot my drink... I would have happily paid for the drink but you were busy being rude because you rang everything out separately. Costing me more money...

Now, why would I want to pay $50 more than what Honda quoted me? The catch was that roadside assistance wouldn't replace my battery for free in the event it died. Instead, this establishment informed me that Honda made a mistake and my battery ISN'T dying, They could restore it back to factory and clean it up for ~$60. I liked that. $200 cheaper!

Wanted to get home because I finally finished school and was graduating. I was scared and definitely couldn't afford a new battery especially when I was quoted $250. I checked autozone, sams club, costco, etc. My last resort was to call AAA. They quoted me $95 (not including tax, supposedly.) The guy got to my house, installed it, I was expecting to pay extra for LABOR and they said this was included in my AAA membership.\\n\\nSo my real question is... Why is this place charging for labor when supposedly it's covered by our membership? And why did I get the same exact battery/warranty for half the price?

I've been trying to find some good produce that is pesticide free, so a farmer's market seemed the best bet. When I arrived I realized that this was not at all what I thought it was going to be. There were hardly any produce vendors. Like maybe 20% were selling produce, the other 80% were selling products or hot food. I was so disappointed. I drove 30 minutes for such a waste of time and effort. If you want to call yourself a FARMER'S market, you should maybe have more actual farmers there. I'm sure this is a great place to shop if you want a few specialty items, but not if you want to find fresh produce. Now, I understand that product vendors are great to have at farmer's markets, and I typically like to buy the specialty items, but when you have basically no produce and all specialty items, I feel like you should no longer be able to market yourself as a farmer's market. To top it all off, one of the produce vendors didn't actually sell individual produce, but was a co-op where you had to sign up for weekly deliveries and couldn't pick out your own produce. So basically it cut down the produce vendors even more. Such a disappointment.", "So we were hung up on again will trying to get the key the opportunity,to correct her problems.

I eventually found the turn table on a display in a different aisle, but there was no price. There were a variety of items on the display, and not a single one had a price sticker or a label on the display. It was like they put anything that didn't have a home onto the display, regardless if they went together. I walked around, trying to find someone to ask the price and there was no one to be found. There were 2 ladies cutting fabric, one at customer service and one at another register. The line to checkout was 10 people deep and I wasn't going to wait just to ask a price. Since they were out of the other item I was looking for anyway, I put the turn table back and went to Michaels in the same shopping center. It was a night and day difference with wide aisles, clean and stocked shelves and clearly marked prices. There were 3 people ringing and I got to my car with both items under 15 minutes.

Somehow he slipped out of his harness and leash... I do not understand how that is possible. Crusher is a chihuahua/daschund mix, so he is a small dog, but the harness fit him perfectly. If he were to slip out, wouldn't the person walking him feel him tugging and struggling to escape? Somehow their story of him just simply escaping his leash made no sense to us. It seems very likely that whoever was walking him was not even paying attention to what Crusher was doing at the time...\\n\\nThey said they had been searching for him for the past two hours but had no luck. We were speechless... We darted out the doors and began searching for him ourselves for the next 5 hours. The staff insisted they were helping us find him but we barely saw anyone out there during the search. I mean, if I worked at that facility and lost someone's pet, I would not stop searching until I found it! They argued that they couldn't keep watch all day because they had a lot of things to do at the hospital as well, which is understandable, but they should have at least had someone out there helping us search for Crusher. They were the ones responsible for losing him, yet they were finding excuses to not be on top of the search. Later on we were told that Crusher was not lost at 9:00am, but instead he was lost at 7:45am. Regardless of what time he was lost, why wasn't his owner informed RIGHT AWAY?? They should have called her the moment he slipped from their fingers! If they called her sooner, we would have been able to head over there right away and search for him. Maybe we would have found him sooner if he heard his mom's voice pleading for him to return... Were they even planning on calling her to give her the bad news? We had to come in to the hospital for them to even mention he was gone..\\n\\nSo after searching for many hours, we decided to stay in Vegas for one more night just in case he was found. Tuesday morning arrived and there was still no news regarding Crusher's whereabouts. That morning we went back to Green Valley. They gave us a list of numbers and addresses of different shelters in the area. We called and visited a few of them trying to find him but still, no luck. Then at 1:30 someone called Green Valley saying they thought they spotted him around Sunset and Valle Verde. We immediately went to the area to find him, searched for hours, and still wasn't able to locate him.. Again, we didn't see ANYONE from the hospital helping us search for him. Time was running out and we had to return to San Francisco soon. We headed back to Green Valley and spoke to them about how disappointed we were that no one was helping us search. We had to head back home to San Francisco and we were worried that no one would bother to look for him once we were gone... They assured us they would not stop searching until they found him. \\n\\nThat evening, we had to leave without Crusher. My friend was so worried about his current condition. It was so hot.. Was he dehydrated? Did he get hit by a car? Did anyone find him and take him in as their own pet? Endless questions but no answers.\\n\\nShe posted a lost and found ad on Craigslist with a picture of Crusher and where he was last seen. After we arrived home, she kept receiving e-mails from people saying they saw a dog like him around the CVS Pharmacy. She continued to call Green Valley to tell them to look for him there. They said they were looking but couldn't find him. It took one of her friends who used to live with her to drive all the way from Southern California to that CVS Pharmacy in Henderson to finally find Crusher. Amazingly, he was able to locate Crusher right away. Crusher recognized his voice and followed him. Although he is malnourished, he is alive and will reunite with his owner very soon!!\\n\\nSomehow we feel that Green Valley did not follow through with what they promised. Yes, they posted up fliers and called local animal shelters, but we feel like Crusher could have been found sooner if they had searched harder. And this whole situation could have been avoided if the person walking him was paying attention in the first place. \\n\\nSo, I do apologize for this long long review. But I want people to be aware of what happened. If it happened to one dog, it can happen to yours.", "I have had hit or miss experiences here.  Many good ones but the last one was so bad I will NEVER go back.  I ordered the crispy tofu with brocolli.  It had very little sauce, the tofu was so uncrispy and the brocolli was not cooked at all... not al dente but HARD.  Then within 20 minutes of leaving I was sick as could be.\\n\\nWhen I complained about my food they took it back to the kitchen and I swear brought the exact same food back to me.", "Pan-asian...always a little fishy as there is no way a restaurant can be good at an entire spectrum of Asian food.  A+ for atmosphere, I love the high ceilings, unique lanterns, and wood finishing on everything.  But let's get down to what really counts--the food!\\n\\nPineapple fried rice---The first thing we noticed is that it was a SOGGY mess.  Any Asian person knows that to make good fried rice, you need day old rice.  I was kind of hoping for fresh pineapple, but of course it was canned.  \\n\\nPlum sushi lunch special--An assortment of fish with a roll.  Very nice presentation, not expertly put together roll but it was passable.\\n\\nTea leaf salad--A disappointment but of course I am comparing it to THE tea leaf salad from Burma Superstar in SF (and there's no comparing to that!).  Still, for what is basically just SALAD, they should not be charging 8 dollars.\\n\\nOverall, what we expected from a pan-asian place.  Perhaps they do some things well and we didn't taste those dishes but we probably won't be rushing back anytime soon.", "I've had a few pies here now, and I appreciate what they're trying to do, but I've been underwhelmed every time. My biggest issue is with the crust. Crust should be a beautiful, flaky, slightly salty base that provides some contrast and structure to the filling. Pie Hole/Mamma's crust is just extraordinarily bland.\\n\\nSeveral of my friends have said much the same (and a few of the other commenters here) and I think that it really holds things back. The fillings are perfectly respectable and sometimes even quite good, but the crust is just nothing to write home about and it really dings the overall experience for me.", "They sold me two nightstands that were broken. After having the technician take a look at them they determened that they needed to order replacement parts. 1 month later I receive the parts. I call the customer service number and they said they would send a technician out on my next day off.. Nobody shows up. After I called they said that the representative made a mistake because they dont service my area that day. \\nI reschedule for my next day that I was available (about 5 days later) I specificly advised them that It needed to be before 2pm because I had a shift that day. I get no call and nobody shows up. Then the tech calls at 3:30pm and said he was at my front door. WTH!!!!  I'm going crazy with this company I work for a living not stay home and wait for something to be fixed that was should not of been broken in the first place..Now they want me to call the day before just in case I dont get a reminder call.\\nI NEED MORE FURNITURE FOR MY HOUSE BUT I WILL NEVER EVER GIVE THESE BROKEN OVERPRICED AND NO RESPECT FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS PERSONAL TIME!!! \\n\\nPLEASE GO ELSEWHERE! THANKS!\\n\\nHopefully they fix my two nightstands that cost me $499 each!", "This place was my neighbor when i lived at Veer Towers. I really tried to like this place but after 4 or 5 visits i did not once leave there impressed. It is just another overpriced vegas strip restaurant lacking in impressive food. The wait staff is severely lacking in attentiveness, the food is not bad but i was expecting much better for a high dollar restaurant. It is a nice location and they keep the place very clean which is important to me but i would much rather spend my money somewhere else.", "This place was very disappointing! The food is mediocre at best and the service was terrible.

There is better out there. There is much better out there.", "Disgusting company. The car you ordered will never be there. Then they ask you to change some other cars which is much smaller!!!

They put us in a non smoking room. When we called to get a room change, it took 25 minutes for the bell man to arrive. (Which cut into some serious drinking time) When we arrived to our second room, the window was covered in graffiti! How can you miss that?!? The house keeper threw my $500 prada sunglasses on the floor so that he could climb on to the table to clean it! \\n\\nWhen we told our story to the front desk manager, she lied to us about the buffet comps she gave us... so we got screwed out of that too! \\n\\nWe were playing at a slot machine and got ignored by two cocktail waitresses. We finally got a hold of one and she was one of the rudest people I have ever met!

I paid $29 for a hot stone pedicure and hand massage valued at $60. I was very excited to try a new place, and assumed it was something special considering I never pay $60 for a pedicure!\\nMy first impression of the boutique was that it was small, modern and I really enjoyed the overall vibe- but where are the pedicure spa chairs?? There was one small chair, and the woman came out from the back carrying a large ceramic bowl filled with hot water. I don't know about anyone else, but I really like the massage chairs and the jets that are standard at most nail salons. It was a disappointment not having that.\\nThe woman who did my pedicure was funny and very friendly, but I don't think she does a lot of pedicures. The paint looked sloppy and since I hadn't worn my own sandals, I left barefoot.\\n\\nCute decor and friendly tech doesn't mean I want to go back for a VERY overpriced, crappy looking pedicure.", "The Excalibur Rountable buffet reminded me of one of those horrible cafeteria type restaurants. My review is based on breakfast. Luckily we had a 2 for 1 coupon so it only cost my partner and I $9 each.\\n\\nI don't really know what to say here except they had all your standard breakfast fare but it was all dried out or soggy. It was not fresh at all. I ddin't even bother to go back and get more food. There was a dessert area that had pastries and donuts. Meh.\\n\\nThe highlight was the waiter who managed to make us laugh.\\n\\nin response to a comment I read down below, yes the food is mass produced but that doesn't mean it can't be great food. There are many other buffets that actually get it right. Try one of those and stay far away from this place.", "Your experience will likely be something like this: you're drawn in as a  response to some sweet offer; you're impressed by the physical space; mildly peeved by their process of collecting your personal information to add you to their database;  you're told some excuse for why the offer doesn't work today, like the shave barber isn't working today; you're willing to give it a whirl anyway; impressed by the stylist and treatments; willing to pay a fair price and consider this a place to return; you will be targeted by slimy swindling tactics when the time comes to pay.  Be wary!  I interpret my experience thus: they have a good concept and a lot invested.  Business is slow and they recognize that many of their clients are out of town'ers; not repeat candidates.  Their 'stay afloat' tactic is to milk every last buck out of the client while he's on the premise, even if it means compromising the experience.  I definitely will not return, even though it was a decent haircut.  Too slippery for my taste.", "So, I first reviewed this buffet in 2010 and it was the best. And although we only visit the buffet a couple times a year, I hadn't noticed any decrease in variety or quality but on our last visit in July, we were disappointed. It was ho-hum. The desserts were cafeteria quality. The rest was ok. I just think you could have found all of the food at any other buffet...even at a station buffet. Recently, we've tried the Wicked Spoon which was phenomenal. Great presentation, high quality and items you do not find at any other buffet...like bone marrow! We also tried the new Bacchanal at Caesars and it put the Wynn buffet to shame. In this town, with all these buffets, the Wynn needs to step it up and keep up with the others. Won't be returning.", "Good first experience. Second was unfortunately my last", "Over-rated! After a number of recommendations, including Yelp, my wife and I decided to have dinner at 'Pomo. The waiter explained the Napoli flavor of the restaurant and their food. Gave us the highlights of the menu. Considering all the showmanship and contrived ambiance we were expecting much better. The pizza was very dissappointing, soggy, very few toppings and tasteless. The salad and drinks were much better, otherwise this would have been a one star rating.  Next time we're in Scottsdale we'll go elsewhere.", "Cox us the worst company I have ever tried to do business with! They give you incorrect quotes, don't call you back when they say they will, stupid customer service people who shouldn't be allowed to talk on the phone, and don't know how to transfer calls.

I went for the second one, thinking I may have just had an inexperienced person.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  My ingrown toenail was make worse, I had to straighten my fingernails again.  I am not using the the third one & will never go back there again.  When did hitting the sides of your legs count as a massage? I have never understood that & make them stop everytime, it hurts and doesn't feel good.", "Really disappointing.   Extremely expensive and I've had better food at the olive garden.  Service and atmosphere are the only positives.  The bill for my wife and I after tip was $350 and we didn't order dessert.  My wife's seafood risotto was so salty it was almost unedible.", "Service and execution need help. On our third visit to modern grove the kitchen was a disaster. Sandwiches came out looking beautiful until you turned it over to discover the bottom was black. Asked for a replacement grilled cheese which they graciously supplied. Unfortunately, the cheese was not melted?\\n\\nFor a group of six, kitchen sent out 2 meals, several minutes later came next 3 meals.

If not for necessity and lack of laundry facilities I would have gone elsewhere. I will never come back to this place again. I hope the laundry owner reads this and retrains their employer.

At the end of the day I come to a restaurant for the food and after this meal I think this will unfortunately be my last visit. \\n\\nPlease, bring back the quality of the Moishe's I fondly remember.", "I've always been a fan of Mimis but it had been about three years since my last visit. My mother and grandpa decided they wanted to do lunch there and I was happy about it. I remembered the location in Mesa being better but since I used to live in Scottsdale, that was the one I frequented. \\n\\nThe menu was basically the exact same as it was three years ago. That could be good or bad. Take it as you will. It was SO crowded. Apparently every single person over 65 decided to go to lunch that Friday afternoon. The food was good but kind of expensive. My mother and I shared a sandwich since we're both small eaters and my grandpa ordered his own. The bill was still about forty bucks for two meals and three iced teas. Even if the food was good that was still YIKES!\\n\\nBut the service was what made me decide to stick to the Mesa location if I ever go again. The waiter took our orders, brought us our drinks once and then vanished off the face of the earth. Maybe he's Superman, IDK!\\n\\nA busboy brought us our food and we had to ask another busboy for our bill. Our waiter made his final appearance just as we'd paid to thank us for coming in. It was awful nice of him to return after being absent for thirty minutes and making the busboy do his job.", "Stay tuned....", "I wouldn't even give The LVH 1 star but yelp makes you give at least 1. This hotel is no longer part of the Hilton family & it is very apparent. The whole place has gone downhill. I've stayed here many times (while the Hilton) & I was very disappointed this time. The rooms were in disrepair, no coffee makers, toilet paper & tissues that you could see thru. I had 4 light bulbs out & they never did come to fix them.  3 of the restaurants are closed now too. And the room rates are still some of the highest in Vegas. It's a shame but for the next convention I'll stay elsewhere.", "Awful. Just, awful. \\n\\nI brought my car in at 8:30am after calling first to ask if they could finish my car by the end of the day and if they had an available courtesy shuttle to take me to work while they had my car. \\n\\nThe gentleman who took my car in, Steve, told me the driver is never out more than 30 minutes and would be back in no time to take me. He also confirmed that my car would be in and out today. \\n\\nWhen I went inside the waiting room, the gentlemen at the desk informed me that the driver only leaves once an hour and it would be 45 minutes before the driver could take me. Not having that kind of time, I arranged another ride and had to walk half a mile and sit in the cold to wait for them. \\n\\nI then got a call from Steve badmouthing the men in the waiting room saying they opened their mouths when they shouldn't have and had no idea what they were talking about. I have very little respect for employees that badmouth the company or co-workers. The men in the waiting room were FAR friendlier and more accommodating than Steve. Had they been the men to do the vehicle intake and follow up with the service, my business would still be Chapman's. \\n\\nSo, after leaving my car off at 8:45 am, I called to check in around noon. Steve said he hadn't heard from his mechanic and he would go ask him and call me right back. An hour later, I had heard nothing. I called back and they couldn't get a hold of Steve. Finally, he was tracked down and it turns out they hadn't even done the diagnostic test yet, let alone start working on my vehicle. \\n\\nI told them not to do anything and I would come pick up the car. When I arrived and asked for my vehicle, Steve seemed a little annoyed that I was taking the car. Yeah, Steve, I'm pissed I have to do this too...\\n\\nI called AutoNation Ford in Scottsdale and a very friendly and informative man, Mike, said he would not charge me to look at the vehicle, (Steve at Chapman wanted $110 unless the issue was covered by warranty, which is standard) and when I brought it in, promptly stopped what he was doing, shook my hand, gave me his card and told me to call him directly with any questions or issues. He came straight out to my car and was honest with the wait time before my car would been seen. \\n\\nAfter looking at more reviews, it seems Chapman is NO NOT NEVER and AutoNation, with whom I've dealt before, is the only dealership I'll go to again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe only reason they got 2 stars was because after speaking with a CSR on LiveChat, a manager called me personally to inquire about my experience. \\n\\nHe was very kind, understanding and did not push me to bring the car back for a second chance. He thanked me for my time and for my feedback and was very professional and personable.", "Horrible motel!

I thought for sure it would be a healthy menu that I could get something I would not regret eating.\\n\\nWalking in the Protein House, I felt a little uncomfortable, there was a huge guy, likely a body builder or fighter hovering over the cashier, and he didn't seem extremely friendly. But, I did take this as a good sign that bodies were the focus in this place and I liked that. \\n\\nI was right, it is a healthy menu, however I do have a problem with a place that calls itself the \\\"\"Protein House\\\"\" or \\\"\"Greens and Proteins\\\"\" for that matter and they have not gotten with the times, that a lot of people do not eat meat anymore. This place does get \\\"\"kudos\\\"\" for having a vegan protein on the menu, which Greens and Proteins does not, but its vegetarian and vegan options for food are a little on the \\\"\"down low.\\\"\"\\n\\nWhy don't you have tofu options for your salads, bowls, etc? or Gardein? Heck the Yardhouse has an entire Gardein menu, get a clue!\\n\\nThey have a black bean and quinoa veggie burger and a veggie bowl. The veggie bowl can be quinoa or brown rice and I love both, but they don't come with a sauce. So, I asked what the sauce was and they looked at me like I was crazy. It doesn't come with a sauce they said, do you want a sauce on the side, and I said yes. What do you have? \\n\\nThe girl was very nice and said we have bbq, teriyaki, balsalmic, blah blah many others. Ok, so I went with teriyaki as I am vegan and I figured this would be the least likely to get messed up with some cheese or cream or something so I chose that one. I specifically asked for NO mushrooms, its the one veggie that I hate.\\n\\nI had to ask how to get my bottle of water and it was uncomfortably quiet in there while I waited for my food, except for the massive TV with the SF 49r's game on and my six year old which were great contributions to the action. They have a table set up in the back that appears to be their office, I found that tacky... now I have some ideas if they want them to make that table cool and fit the theme, like make it a judges table, autograph table or nutrition booth or something, but to sit out there in the public like that is just unprofessional. \\n\\nWhen I did receive my food, it was FULL of mushrooms, but I was starving and it wasn't meat or cheese so I attempted to pick them out as I went along. The veggies were gorgeous, asparagus, peppers, cauliflower, zucchini and the quinoa was cooked perfectly. My only suggestion is for them not to cut the veggies up so small, this is the main part of the veggie dish and they were diced teeny tiny seeming like I was still missing the main dish.\\n\\nOh, the sauce... well the first sauce was my teriyaki and it looked creamy! How does teriyaki get creamy? I don't know, but I'm not eating it. I asked for something else, I got the balsamic. It looked chunky and not like any balsamic I have ever seen. So, unfortunately my opinion on the sauces is very poor. If you serve a bowl of any kind, don't you need a sauce?\\n\\nI guess I'm the only one who ever asked for a sauce as they looked at me like an alien when I asked for one. Last but not least. SALT. I know, its not the best for you, but I need flavor on my food.\\n\\nAt the Protein House, I walked around and found pepper but no salt. And, they couldn't find salt. I mean I know you are a bunch of manly and womanly body builder types, but 99% of the population wants some salt on their food.\\n\\nThey finally found me some in the kitchen in a cabinet and had to put it in a little dish for me. Wow, Gordon Ramsay would have had a hay day with that episode.\\n\\nAll in all, I appreciate the whole idea of the place, its supposed to be trendy and focused on body building, but they have to be realistic that the bodybuilding population is such a small percentage of their potential revenue, that they have to open their minds to all the other healthy people out there that might want to eat there.\\n\\nAfter today, I will not go back, unless of course I see a change of the way I was treated or (sized up), the menu and the atmosphere. Otherwise if they were going on food only, minus the mushroom mistake, the food concept is one that I would love!", "I've experienced better, much better.

I told them no and took my PS3 back.\\n\\n One week later I called before hand to make sure that I didn't drive all the way over there again to be upset. When I talked to the owner he asked me what they did to repair it. Shouldn't he know since he owns the place? The owner wanted the 20$ for the troubleshooting fee and I refused to accept this.

My daughter was hysterically sobbing as I was then reprimanded by phlebotomist for not having her sit on my lap. (I wouldn't have minded doing that, but she made it sound optional rather than critical when she asked earlier. If she had warned me this might happen, I would have gladly sat with her.) Again, there were no words to calm my daughter down or even a \\\"\"sorry.\\\"\" She asked if we wanted to draw the sample on the other arm since we had collected no blood at this point. Meanwhile, my daughter is so hysterical there was no way I could have her work on the other arm. The phlebotomist made me feel like I was in the way and should get moving out of the office if I wasn't going to do the other arm. My daughter hyperventilated practically the whole 15 minute drive home, crying that she never wants to get blood taken ever again. In my opinion, the staff should be coached and trained on how to handle nervous children or even calm down someone who is upset.

All I can say is this was the worst meal I have ever had in Madison, and I have had some bad ones. \\n\\nA party of 3, my husband, his mother and myself.  We were seated near the fish tank, in the fairly dark back 1/2 of the room.  As soon as we sat down my husband looked up because something was dripping from the ceiling on his head.  He endured a few more drips before moving to the other side of the table. \\n\\nOur server was a peach, very sweet and good at her job.  That was the only good part I can really say.  They ordered the bisque and it came out lukewarm, but my husband said it wasn't bad.   Then came the salads: Iceburg chunks, with some jicima, crutons, mandarine oranges and some wilted greens.  I orderd the strawberry vinagrette, it was chunky pink glops on the salad and tasted off.  I figured it may just be me not likeing their \\\"\"jerk\\\"\" seasoning mixed with the strawberries, but my husband who had a different dressing also thought his was odd. \\n\\nIt got worse for the entrees, I had the pecan crusted grouper; DH ordered a bone in seasoned pork ; MIL Jerk Pork.  MIL complained that it was too peppery, but I can't completly fault the restruant for that since she did order Jerk.  But.. hubbys pork was a tough as shoe leather, and had no bone.  He couldn't even cut it with a knife, he ate 2 bites and left it.   Now my grouper was the straw that broke the camels back... the pecans were burnt, yet the fish was still RAW in the middle.  The only way I can figure this is that it was cooked frozen, how else do you burn the outside and keep the inside raw.    \\n\\nAt least the server took my fish off the bill, but we were charged for everything else!!

But the people who run it make it a 'never go back' experience unless you love to be humiliated by snobs.", "Decided to get a mani and pedi done for Christmas. Started off really good quick to get on a chair for my pedi. I wanted snowflakes and the lady said she could do them. Pedi seemed really rushed. Once pedi was done went on to getting my nails done. She wasn't rushing at first but the more time pass by more people started to show and out of all the workers she was the only one rushing. As she was doing my nails she kept looking around not realizing that she is taking off a lot of the nail. Also she kept filing and filing my nails which ended up shorter than I wanted.  Everyone else was taking their times. I told her to slow down so she wouldn't mess up but sure enough, my nails Didnt turn out the way i wanted them to be done. Snowflakes don't even look like snowflakes. If she wasn't able to do the design I wanted she should of said so instead of going through with it and saying that's the best she can do. one side of my nails were done and it would of looked stupid for me to walk out with my hands looking different from each other. Never again will I go to this nail salon.", "Don't bother unless your starved. Fairly average at best slice. Probably good if you trying to get some filler before drinking cuz you'll get it quick. Otherwise pass.", "My first trip to Vegas and I had to eat here. I was expecting all this great food from all the rave for Vegas buffets, but I guess I just stepped into the wrong one. Buffets back home are better for less than half the price. Even Hometown Buffet is better in my opinion and I am NOT a fan of Hometown Buffet.\\n\\n$35 for all day!? I thought I was hearing & seeing things, but you get a WATERPROOF wristband to go back to two buffets all day! Wow such a great deal right? NO. The food sucked and there was no variety.", "Wow I don't know where to begin. I had this place at 5 stars but that was for the old doctor and evaluation. I guess everyone is nice when they're taking your money. I posted earlier with the thought that i would get my contacts but I'm still waiting - 7 months and counting!!  Customer service is non-existent in this place so STAY AWAY!!\\n\\nI was waiting for them to call me when they received the third contact brand in my strength, but I've had to call them three times now! Absolutely NO communication.  This time Mary belle tells me i have to get a whole new exam done because the doctor is in another location and can't sign my prescription.  Again, great communication to the patients huh? All i want now is the air optics brand so at least ill get something for all that money and time wasted, but she said no way.  I asked for the manager but he won't be in until Thursday. I'm going in to talk to him face to face on that day...\\n\\nTo be continued...", "I decided to come here since the places near my house are just ok. Lets just say I should have just went to a place near my house. This place was defiantly just ok. The place looks really nice and clean, which I like. The male nail tech that worked on me seemed very grumpy and I would say didn't do the best job and didn't care to do the best job either. I am 8 months pregnant and wanted to treat my poor feet to nice pedicure and it was just ok. I was disappointed. The only time he seemed nice was when I tipped him. I think I would have enjoyed myself with another nail tech more. It's a shame.", "Besides all the pretty handsome men at the Cosmo and Marquee. I was highly disappointed for my first time there :(. My friends and I planned a trip out to Vegas and bought pre sale tickets to see Kaskade on April 6th .. We get there extremely excited, all dressed up and ready to dance... We decide to sit outside for a moment since my legs were killing me from walking, I'm not sure how many flights of stairs that lead us to to the club (wearing heals didn't help). When kaskade gets on we hurry inside and it's packed like no other.. To a point where everyone was pushing and shoving to get out of each others way. I was stuck for a moment in the bustling crowd and couldn't even move. It was ridiculous. I don't know why Marquee had let that many people in all at once, fire hazard ?? We ended up just going into the hip hop room to get some fresh air since they closed the outside.. Waiting to try and go back just in case it cleared up. We go back and it's still packed... We try to bustle our way to the dance floor where kaskade is playing and where the real hype and vibe was .. And the security guard was shooing people away from the dance floor and not letting anyone in :( I was so disappointed and bummed I couldn't see kaskade and that I was only able to hear him on the surround sound.. I knew half the people there wernt even there for kaskade and were there just to be \\\"\"seen\\\"\". It was so annoying. After that ridiculousness the boys in our group just decided for us to leave. We ended up randomly at a trashy strip club called Sapphire.. Were we paid $35 each to get in and realize even if we just wanted to chill and drink we had to does another $20 each for one drink. So much for a Vegas trip and trying to see one of your favorite artists to watching trashy women strip for trashy men :( Marquee I was looking forward to an amazing experience :( at least on Friday night for a random adventure I'm so glad I Stumbled across the new Nightclub at the Mandalay Bay called the Light Vegas. We got to go in free with free drink tickets to see A-Trak and it was so much fun... The layout was perfect and you could see everything. If you haven't checked it out yet you should .. They're run by a Cirque du so Leil theme (dancers and performance) and it's beautiful !", "This Fresh & Easy is a smaller store in comparison to the others in the city. This location is right in the ghetto of North Las Vegas. Yes I admit I shop here on occassion but it's only for one or two items. I'll go to a different one or Smith's. Thanks.", "Attended the U2 concert here. The stadium itself is nice, but not the best place for a concert, especially one with such a grand set-up and special effects. Bono explained that with this tour, they're going for \\\"\"intimacy on a grand scale.\\\"\" The intimacy was definitely missing at this venue! Since that element was a conscious effort on the band's part, imagine a show where that wasn't the intention -- you'd feel even farther away from the performers. \\n\\nIt sorta felt like the venue was competing with, rather than supporting, the music. From the first drumbeat on, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of wanting to shut out the stadium itself and focus on the music. Could have been a lot worse -- could have been better. Was confused and bummed at the images on the 360 screen during \\\"\"City of Blinding Lights\\\"\" and \\\"\"Unforgettable Fire\\\"\" (ohmigod -- to hear that live -- never would I have dreamed!) -- could have been so beautiful, but something was wrong. It's possible that the place was too lit up for the images to be clear on the screen, or there was some sort of malfunction. I don't know. \\n\\nThe bathroom lines were ridiculous, but the facilities were clean. I do have one thing to say: don't block the sinks for everyone else just to primp! Witness the crowds behind you! Wash your hands and then, use your own mirror; I see one in your hands with your face powder. I know you want to look gorgeous for the guys on stage, but your pores are NOT going to be visible from where you're standing. Sheesh. I totally relate to being worked up for these performers but I also need to use the sink.\\n\\nDidn't visit any concessions so can't comment on those. Overall, staff were great and concert-goers were pretty polite, but then, I wasn't on the Floor where the crazy general admission mosh was going on. Heard later that there were a lot of mean drunks. Whassup, aren't U2 fans supposed to be more humane than average? I guess people are people...\\n\\nWe had 17th row, on Adam's side of the stage. That meant we saw very little of Edge except what was on the screen. He took a walk once or twice down our catwalk, but it's never enough! \\n\\nA great show, just o.k. venue.", "I've been craving cupcakes for a few weeks, and it looks like I might have to keep looking after a stop yesterday at Mad Hatter Cupcakes. \\n\\nI ordered a red velvet cupcake with chocolate ganache filling and cream cheese frosting. \\n\\nMy first bite I noticed something strange. The cupcake was moist but the top of it was so dry there was a crunch to it. So crunchy that when I told my boyfriend to listen to me chew he goes \\\"\"Eew. Gross. What's the matter with your cupcake?\\\"\"\\n\\nThe chocolate ganache was not a ganache I've ever experienced-it was really more like chocolate pudding. The cream cheese frosting was sweet and had a nice concistancy but lacked that cream cheese-iness that I was looking for. \\n\\nOverall conclusion is I love the concept so can't hate these guys for trying. They have a huge selection, but maybe it's too much for them to handle. The quality of the ingredients needs to be improved, so most likely will save my 3 bucks and go somewhere else for now.", "I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them, and when I arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the place was locked and dark and no one was there!  I waited for five minutes (in the rain), and they still didn't show.  I called and left a voicemail saying that I was still willing to wait, and I understood if there was some confusion, but could they call my cell (I gave them the number, as I had previously given my home number when I made the appointment).  I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \\\"\"Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'  Seriously?  When I was waiting, another woman came to the door.  I thought she worked there, but she was just another client, also trying to get in!  When I told this story at another local business, the women there said that I was probably the fourth person who had had this same experience at this place.  I couldn't believe it.  This place is the worst, and I have never even stepped inside!", "We love the show and Ramsey ' s unwillingness to except anything less than perfection. That being said I was disappointed with my meal. To start I had the octopus fingerling salad. The octopus was wonderful.  Tender not chewy. Also tried the fried oysters they too were great, onto the main which took too long to arrive. We ordered the short ribs, skirt steak and I had the lamb duo so it's not like we ordered the beef wellington. My lamb was cold I ordered it med rare but it came rare which adds to why it was cold. The portions were on the small side but I will overlook such things in exchange for excellence which is what I expected but was sadly let down. The best for me was the bone marrow I ordered as a side. Service was okay. Over all it was hit and miss and over priced.", "Big screens? Check. Novelty sports memorabilia on the walls? Check. Giant booths suitable for big crowds? Check. Ability to make a decent burger? ............. \\n\\nHickory Tavern is one of those places that is all for show, with a no-go on good food. Ordered a Honey BBQ burger, and the waitress and the courtesy to ask me how I wanted it cooked. Apparently the chef didn't feel like obliging her, and sent me out a well-done burger instead. \\n\\nApparently a Honey BBQ burger is a regular burger, with a side of honey mustard and a side of bbq sauce. Looking at them, I was skeptical to mix them on my burger, so after experimenting on my plate I did discover that no, sweet and spicy honey mustard and smoky bbq sauce do not create a favorable taste once mixed together. En short, I could have just gotten a regular burger.\\n\\nI was delighted that instead of just fries or chips, I could get a side of steamed vegetables. Unfortunately, they were soggy and completely tasteless except for a twist of pepper and a sad attempt at a garlic chunk at the bottom for flavoring. \\n\\nThe person I was with got the teriyaki chicken burger, and while the chicken was very moist and well cooked, this thing must have been marinating for a hell of a long time. The teriyaki flavor was almost overwhelming, and extremely salty. \\n\\nMaybe their more expensive meals are made with more care. But if you advertise yourself as a sports tavern and you can't make a good burger, that is a complete out for me. There are plenty of local places where you can watch the game that are cozier, more personable, and know how to actually make a burger to a customer's specifications. For two people, I wouldn't waste your time on this place.\\n\\n\\nEr, the Woodchuck was good.", "Heard great things about this place but wasn't impressed. It took over an hour to get our dinner. Had simple fettuccini Alfredo w chicken. It had decent taste but the sauce had the consistency of soup. It was so runny I could not eat it w my fork. The only place I saw the chicken was on my bill! On a good note the bread was good! \\nSadly this will make my list of the \\\"\"one and done\\\"\".", "I've been to this location 3 separate times and enjoyed the food the first two times.  However, last night was the first time I had a bad experience.  I specifically came for the Sea Bass, as it was fantastic the last two times I ordered it.  I split it with my date and we also shared a Shrimp Cocktail and Salad.  The shrimp and salad were first rate.  The fish however was not cooked, and a piece I cut for my girlfriend was raw.  When I mentioned it to the server, she quickly had another entr\\u00e9e remade for us.  We were told by the server that they intentionally cook the Sea Bass \\\"\"medium\\\"\".  This fish was obviously under cooked by accident.  Both times I've  ordered  this dish in the past it was cooked perfectly, so I know what to expect.  In the end the manager comp'd us for the Bass, but did not offer anything else to make up for their mistake.  It would have been nice if he had offered something additional for our bad experience.  In the end I paid $60 for a salad, shrimp cocktail, and 2 glasses of wine.  I know they have good steaks here, but next time I want fish I'll go to a seafood restaurant'", "Took my car in for a new battery.  The told me it would take less than a hour.  I wait an hour walk up front and the short little guy says do you want me to check on your car.  I look out front door and my car is in same spot.  I tell the guy my car is right there.  Right away he apologizes then says can I wait 20 min.  Which it did not take 20 minutes. Much longer.

Initially everything was fine. The food was ok, the wine was good, and the server was good. It gets a bit crowded on a Friday after work so it's a little loud and can be hard to find seating. \\n\\nIn the middle of our meal the manager or the owner (tall, thin, silver haired gentleman in his 50s?) comes over to our table and grabs the chair my (large very noticeable) purse was placed in, leaving me with no choice but to quickly snatch my purse before he takes it with him to another table. I looked at my friend in shock like \\\"\"What?\\\"\" as a group of guys at  the next table over look at me with shock on their faces. Clearly we were all thinking the same thing \\\"\"What the hell? Did he really just do that?\\\"\". I left there with little enthusiasm about the place. \\n\\nThe second time I went back was again on a week day, around the same time. The place wasn't busy just yet and I was quickly seated at a table. I sipped on a glass of wine, waiting a couple minutes for my friend. The place started to fill in a bit and I was then informed that I would be moving to a different table so they could accomodate a larger party. Rather than move, I decided to leave.\\n\\nWhat is it with this place and their lack of manners? What ever happened to ASKING someone if they would mind if you took the chair or if they would mind moving to a different table?

I asked for something like a turkey club and they served me a 6 inch sub with lettuce, mayo, turkey, tomatoes and bacon. That's it. When I was ordering, I told the woman at the register that it was my first time here and I was hoping to have something that would bring me back.... She was deaf apparently.\\nThe bacon was so weak that Subway bacon would've turned its nose up at it.... It was barely cooked and half raw.\\nThey gave me 2 thin slices of turkey for every 4 inches of sub. The turkey wasn't roasted, baked or offered any flavor whatsoever. It was grocery store bought turkey, slattered with mayo on a sub roll.\\nThe roll wasn't bad, but far from Gourmet.\\nThe restaurant was clean and painted very fun, but it didn't get close to making up for my crappy sandwich. \\nI gave it two stars because it's almost impossible to mess up a turkey sandwich, and although they didn't mess it up, they did leave a lot of be desired.\\n\\nBottom line....

But that's just your typical day club atmosphere and not why I rated this pool so low.\\n\\nFirst of all, this place is FILTHY. We walked in and the whole place smelled like urine and drunken desperation. We had a cabana and the little carpet inside was sticky under our feet. The daybed attached to our cabana was lined with towels but they were all stanky and full of questionable stains. Like, seriously? A $1500 cabana and the staff can't change the towels on the day bed? And I cannot convey enough how disgusting the pool was. The water was thick and soupy with random floating debris and hair floating everywhere. It looked like it hadn't been properly cleaned in a month. I stepped in up to my shins and it was at that point I decided that fully submerging in that sewer water would surely result in a staph infection or pregnancy. I got out and had long ass hair stuck to my foot. I was, and still am, totally grossed out.\\n\\nThe food we ordered was very good but the staff wasn't super attentive. Again, for a$1500 cabana with auto grat, the service should have been stellar. It was getting to the point where I wanted to put a little bell around my server's neck. \\n\\nSeriously. When I dress up, wait in line, deal with the cockbag doormen, and pay a million dollars for food and drinks, I expect a clean cabana, attentive service and pool water that isn't an eleven on a scale of 1 to Erin Brockovich.", "Didn't enjoy the food at all. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the staff was super friendly. The steak wasn't cooked the right way, actually sent it back twice and they still put in on my bill. Never going back there that's for sure. Total rip off !!", "I would probably not book with Rio ever again. Although they have a lot of slots and decent restaurants the room was outdated and we got charged an additional $20 per person which is a resort fee.

Come to find out, I was given a prescription that wasn't even near what it should have been!  FOR YEARS   No wonder why I couldn't see!  My daughter who went to a new doctor in RENO, the same thing.  The doctor that examined her said that she was being over prescribed.  Both of us were patients of Dr Lorenz  for at least 10 years.  As well as customers at the optical department there.  I brought my glasses to them today because my anti glare was chipping off after only about a year and a half, only to be told that they are out of the 1 year warranty.

I know how busy restaurants get on Saturdays. \\n2. I understand it was exactly the time for that late dinner/drinks crowd.\\n3. The North Shore gets crazy when there is a Pitt game, even away games.\\n4. I have worked in restaurants before. \\n\\nTHE WAIT:\\nThat all being said, we expected a longer wait for a table. What we didn't expect though, was to be told that they \\\"\"in no way could even give you an estimate on how long this will take.\\\"\"  We had a party of 5 people, not a large group at all. After standing outside in the beautiful weather drinking beers, we soon realized that we'd been waiting for nearly 2 hours.\\n\\nEventually this lovely hostess, Christine, approached us (they call your cell phone when a table becomes available) and asked us how long we'd been there. We told her and she immediately got us a table. She was truly a great employee. \\n\\nTHE FOOD:\\nFinally seated, it was another 5-10 minutes before a waiter came over. His name was Bobby and he was clearly young and new to serving. He was running circles around the tables. He obviously had a full section. \\n\\n2 in our party ordered wings as an appetizer and those actually came out really quickly. They smelled great and I don't think either of them had any qualms with the taste either. This is where took a quick and crazy downturn. We asked the waiter for napkins and refills on beers, we didn't see him again for 10-15min. I actually had to flag down a bus boy/food runner for napkins/silverware. The waiter stopped back and we reminded him about the drinks we needed, which by this point had gone from 2 to 4 beers. We placed our order and 1 in our party ordered the 36 steak. In case you're not familiar with this it's a 56$ 36oz steak. This is a serious piece of meat. He ordered it medium well, and the waiter did let us know that this may delay the food coming as this steak is thick. The rest of us ordered various burgers. By this point I'm starting to get hangry (an anger driven by extreme hunger). \\n\\nI made certain to stop and tell 2 manager/supervisory types how great Christine was doing and she had even stopped back to check on us just to make sure things were ok! \\n\\nTHE HORROR:\\nWe have been at this place for 3 hours now. Waiting for food for a little over 1.5 hours. The general manager stops over to our table with some of the absolute WORST customer service skills I've ever encountered. He did apologize, but it went like this... \\\"\"We really don't know when you food will be out. Our kitchen is sort of down right now. It's coming eventually, bro.\\\"\" The member of our party who ordered the 36 actually asked him to just forget the steak and get us 5 burgers to go so we could go back to our boat. He also mentioned that if the meal was free we would leave with our burgers to go, make sure to really take care of the server, and leave as happy as possible. \\n\\nThe manager's exact words... \\\"\"I don't care if the server gets taken care of, I just want the customers to be happy.\\\"\" I was so offended. As I mentioned, I've worked in the food industry as did someone else in our party. That's just too much. \\n\\nThe food came out about 5 minutes after that, including the steak. The steak was so bad that my friend couldn't eat it. It was cold and dry it almost made me choke. This was Denny's/Eat N Park grade steak, not 56$ steak. My boyfriend and our friend had the deep fried burger, I tasted that and it was delicious too.  \\n\\nHere is where I snapped though... I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I am shaky at this point as I've been on a boat in the sun and haven't eaten anything. I put the top of the bun on my burger and grab a steak knife as I almost always have to cut a burger in half. \\n\\nI saw the burger in half, drooling as meat juices (I also like it medium rare.) and bbq sauce is squishing out. I pick up half of the burger and notice in the very low lighting something far brighter pink than the meat right in the middle of my burger. A PIECE OF PINK PLASTIC IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BURGER. I knew immediately what it was, it was the medium rare indicator that they are supposed to stick in the top of the burger. It was laying flat IN THE MIDDLE OF MY MEAT. \\n\\nI shot up out of my seat and took it right back inside and forced the manager to take it from me. I reminded him that this food can't get any more free than it is right now, and I don't have another 3 and a half hours to wait for food. He tried to tell me that it couldn't have been inside it. To which I picked up the other half and pulled the cut in half indicator out of the center. I didn't even get to eat dinner after 4 hours of waiting.\\n\\nNever ever ever again.

There were also some interactions between what I am guessing were employees that just was not appropriate in my opinion in a restaurant.

He tells me come sit over here takes me with him and sends the lady that was doing my nails to work on another customer. He then starts to work on my nails I assume he knew what I wanted because before sending me to him he spoke to the lady in Vietnamese so I  assumed he was asking about my nails. Well long story short he cuts my nails so short I told him why did you do that couldnt you see my other hand how your coworker left it I have natural long nails and all I wanted to get some gel and you filed it too short. Instead of apologizing to me he started to argue that he had asked me how I wanted them and he was filing them square and that he cant do the same job as the other lady, then why the heck did he switch me???? he continue to argue with me and I finally had enough got up from the chair and walked out with one hand with long nails and the other with short nails DONT EVER COME TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!", "Also geschmacklich haut mich der Laden nicht um.

Every time I go, I ask myself why I keep coming back. The last straw was when my dog cracked his toe nail at home at 7:48 pm. The vet closes at 8 so I called to let them know we were on our way. The receptionist said ok, you have 10 mins. To get there, I drove like a crazy person being that my dog was bleeding like crazy. We arrived at 7:56. After checking us in and putting us in a room, we waited. And waited. Finally after 20 mins the tech came in and said: the doc wanted me to make sure you know there is going to be an emergency vet fee bc it's after 8. My jaw was on the floor. I said No, that's not ok I was here before 8, that's ridiculous. The tech left the room, said she would come back and we waited some more. She never came back. Finally the doc came in and started talking about what he would do about the nail never mentioning the emergency fee. He had my dogs leash wrapped around his hand. I asked about the fee and I said I didn't understand why he would charge us for that as we have 3 dogs and bring them a lot of business. He then began to explain that I was delaying the office being closed and he had to pay his techs OT to stay and....I stopped him right there and told him we were there before 8 and that I don't need him to explain to me how his business is run. He then said, he was considering not charging the fee, but considering the way I was acting, that he was now thinking he would charge it. I asked for my dog back and he refused to give him to me.

We were both craving seafood, and had never been here before.  When we arrived, we asked our waitress if there was a happy hour going on.  There was a happy hour and she gave us the menu for it and said she'd be back in a minute to take our order.  The happy hour ended 2 minutes after she gave us the menus, and she came back over 10 minutes later to take our drink order.  Needless to say, we were unable to take advantage of any specials.  We both ordered margaritas for our drinks.  They took a further 15 minutes to come out.  Not only were the drinks weak (and this is coming from a bartender), but one margarita was a substantially different color than the other (despite being the same type).  Additionally, we were charged over $7 apiece for those margaritas that were made with well liquor.  If I'm spending $7 on a margarita, it had either better be tasty or strong (or both).  Anyway, we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer.  We got the Raspberry-maple scallops.  There were cooked well, but served in a watery sauce that removed almost all of the raspberry-maple flavor..  Then we ordered dinner.  We both ordered their broiled seafood medley, which comes with a salad.  I had the caesar salad, although I used the word \\\"\"salad\\\"\" in the loosest sense possible.  There was lettuce there, but only after I uncovered it from a cup of croutons and a cup of parmesan cheese (not the fresh kind).  I spent about 5 minutes just trying to reach the lettuce in my salad under all that other stuff, and even when I finished I still had more cheese than lettuce.  While we were eating our salads our entrees were brought out, and we had the luxury of watching them grow cold while we finished our salads.  I'm sorry, but when I'm spending $30 on a entree I would like it served hot and after my salad.  Additionally, we were not provided a change of silverware at any point during our meal and I kept having to \\\"\"clean\\\"\" my fork and knife on a spare napkin.  During our meal I ordered a second drink (beer this time, since liquor is apparently too difficult for them) and had to wait another 10 or so minutes before it was brought out.  I had also run out of water and had to wait 15 minutes before it was even noticed, let alone waiting for a refill.  While there were aspects of this evening that were frustrating, I must say that all of my seafood was cooked perfectly (I just wish I had been able to enjoy my entree while it was hot).  When we had eaten our fill and asked for the to-go boxes, the waitress asked to bring our check.  We still wanted another round of drinks and possibly dessert, but she never asked for either.  Despite the feeling that we were being rushed and she wanted to hurry us along, I decided to order another drink.  In my opinion, it is good manners to make customers feel welcome, relaxed, and not rushed.  We did not feel any of these things.  This was supposed to be our date night and there were just so many little annoyances along the way.  Once again, the food was really well cooked, and if I could have left my tip for the kitchen staff instead of the waitress I would have.  They certainly earned it, and she didn't really seem to care.  Also, while our wait times could be expected during a lunch/dinner rush, there were maybe 7 people in the whole restaurant.  It's not like they were busy.  Our waitress was just too preoccupied with chatting with the other servers (in clear view of our table).\\n\\nIn short, I do not believe we will be dining here again.  We can get the same quality of food for cheaper and with much better service.", "Big 5 reminds me of Big Lots of sporting goods..

That's what I'd imagine paying for a lunch, and/or for something with greater quantity of more diverse selection and better quality too.\\n\\nThe variety seems limited, very limited for a buffet.  They had for breakfast, from what I remember, only a few food stations including:  Fresh Omelet / Scramble Grill with a Chef, but otherwise just steam trays of:  Corned Beef Hash, Waffles, Pancakes, Apple Crepes, Cheese Crepes, PORK Based Meats (Bacon and Sausages), Eggs, Toast and some pastries, breads and fruit.  So, if you're Jewish or Muslim and can't eat the swine, know that there's not much selections other than their pork based breakfast meats.\\n\\nIf gambling income in a hotel subsidizes meals, this set-up should either be complimentary to those who gamble or are hotel guests, or cost no more than $5.99 to bring people in.\\n\\nThe food quality wasn't bad, it was edible, and as I like to say in a cliched way, \\\"\"I wouldn't throw her outta bed\\\"\" - - so, can't complain that it didn't do the trick to fulfill the ultimate goal of feeding an appetite.  The rating I'm giving this is more based on \\\"\"in comparison to both what's available in the area and what you can get or that same price elsewhere nearby\\\"\" so, if I were to make a suggestion, I'd say they need to improve to keep up with the competition in other hotel casinos.\\n\\nIt's located in a lower level, and had a line to wait in (not sure how many patrons were 1st time visitors as opposed to repeat visiting fans, i'd guess all were newbies) that went by fast to get seated.\\n\\nThe drinks are self service, as of course the buffet food is, so it does the job as far as being a fast way to get fed and get in and out quickly.\\n\\nFor those who are coming to the Luxor, the self-parking is not connected to the Hotel / Casino, so it's a tad off-site, where you have to walk outside a little bit and a short distance, but for those who that's an issue for, be warned or go to the Valet.", "Hey today the Monday night of 9/1/14, the manager was wrong!

There's definitely better pizza to be had in downtown Phoenix (*cough* Cibo *cough*).  I was surprised that Brick is where Pizzeria Uno used to be at Arizona Center.\\n\\nOur first clue about its mediocrity should have been that this place was deserted on a Saturday night.  There were maybe four occupied tables when we got there around 6:30.  Even when we left around 8:00 it was still empty.  We had the hummus plate as an appetizer and it was mediocre.  Honestly it tasted like chick peas that had been run through the food processor with no other flavors added to it.  There's only one pita on the platter, and they actually charged us for an extra one when we asked.  The cheese plate we had was pretty awesome and definitely worth the money.  The pizza was just okay.  We had the one topped with pork belly, smoked salmon, and a fried egg.  It was definitely a new twist on pizza, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  Then of course after all was said and done we had to pay for parking, even after having it validated.  The Arizona Center just isn't worth it.

My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a go. We ordered a large veggie pizza along with the breaded mushrooms and french fries. The first thing that i couldn't get my head around was having to order from Grubhub. Is it that of an inconvenience that i can place my order and payment over the phone. I understand that they must get a lot of orders, well at least i think they do, but having to make an account and order? We were hungry so we just did it any ways. \\nNow let me get to the food, i understand that everyone has a different way of making pizzas but damn this pizza was an utter mess. Working with cooks, i would expect a bit more effort from a \\\"\"World Famous\\\"\" pizzeria. The crust was dull and lacked flavor. I don't mind a pizza that is crunchy but when there is no flavor, it just asking for trouble. The pizza sauce was non existent. They must have just splashed it on and threw it in the oven.I would bite into the slice and i would just taste matzos. The cheese, had no flavor. Now the toppings, i would expect a little more with a veggie pizza. There must have been 3 of each topping which were bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, and olives. Some garlic might have been nice touch but nothing. \\nThe fries were ok. Reminded me of the crinkle cut fries from Del Taco. The fries had a seasoning salt that was ok but a bit soggy once they arrived. \\nThe breaded mushrooms were ok as well but just tasted like they were taken from the freezer and thrown in the fryer. No ranch to go with it. They were ok on their own so we enjoyed them out of everything we ate. \\nWhat can i say about this place? They need to revise their recipes or be taught on how to make a decent pizza. I actually went the Gold Coast the next day and had a slice of pizza from the buffet line and it actually tasted better than this place. That goes to show a lot.

If I was able to give a zero star rating, I feel that would be a too generous of a rating for Trop-aquarium.  So let me expand on the facts I've experienced with this company.  First off Trop-Aquarium is the company that installed my 500 gallon fresh water tank which is built in a double sided wall.  The reason why we chose them was because they were less expensive than all the other quotes we received.  But in this case you really get what you pay for and less.  The reason for obtaining such a large fresh water tank was because I love large fish like big parrot fish and mainly an Arrowana.  We had 35 very large fish in the tank that we paid handsomely to Trop- Aquarium.  One Friday at noon 6 of our large fish died so because Trop- Aquarium maintained our tank, I texted, called and left a message immediately!  No response for a whole 3 days.  By now I'm frantically calling them because all 30 of my expensive fish had died.  Finally they pick up the phone and asked if I had over fed the fish, giggling and that they'll come in a day or two.  However meanwhile I, an unexperienced aquarium maintainer, was told that I need to remove all 30 dead corpses and to buy an airline with air rocks, 2 large buckets, tube everything properly, catch the remainder live fish, place them in the properly tubed buckets all at 12:36 am midnight.  They also offered if I don't know how to just leave the tank with only the dead fish removed, but I was sure all the live fish would've died by the time they came.  When they finally came days after, they realized that they had not glued down the returns.  So all the fish brutally suffocated before dieing.  The Trop-Aquarium technician cleaned the tank, drilled random visible holes in the Clear Vision tank to stick the airline pipe attached to the air rock that I had both purchased.  They verbally admitted to the installation error!  They then replaced our dead fish with 5 fish which were the size of a silver dollar.  Soon after their billing called us and said we owed them over $1000 for the work they did to fix the installation problem they created!  I contacted other aquarium builders and when they saw the tank, all six companies stated and agreed that no one ever would build a tank with no overflow mini tank and returns at the bottom.  Trop-Aquarium did this so that they would be the exclusive company to convert the tank, maintain it and also this way, they'd make a larger profit!  So, in conclusion, if you have limitless amount of money to burn,  want the cheapest specimen of fish in your fish tank, never want to get a timely response, and over all get scammed in the long run, Trop-Aquarium would be perfect for you!!!  Time is the true revealer of how a people are and how companies truly operate.  During my rough 5 year relationship with Trop- Aquarium, I come to realization that making $$$MONEY$$$ is their only priority and having a honest customer oriented business is NOT!!!!!  I WOULD NEVER WISH THIS EXPERIENCE UPON ANYONE ELSE!  You may have to pay a little more initially with another company, but in the long run over all, you will exceed a great amount of money you ever envisioned with Trop-Aquarium.", "I have been here twice and both times were horrible.

He said call back if the problem occurs again,no second charge for the service call,fair enough.It did 1 week later,he came and did the same thing,only this time he  charged the system which made no difference!.Then he went in the attic and said it must be a problem with the TXV valve but the part was not on his truck anyway,he said he had to ask someone with more experience to make sure?He said he was sorry and would call me in the morning. Why? They advertise 24 hr service,and shouldn't they have many popular parts in stock at their shop, or at least have a good supply network? He never called next morning,when I called,I was told by the secretary that they couldn't figure what was wrong and would refund my service fee,but how can you run a company and leave someone in 100 degree heat?

Charles, my tech, had his headphones in while I was trying to talk to him and gave me a quote to clean two rooms for $120 above the initial price. They say that they match prices, wrong, they don't price match it's a LIE, FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!! I Told the supervisor, jamie, he needs to remove the price match ad because they will not honor it.  I spoke with the \\\"\"supervisor, Jamie\\\"\" who was very ghetto and unprofessional and spoke over me instead of hearing what the problem was. I told him that I understood that the \\\"\"high traffic areas\\\"\" would not come out perfect, but even the lighter areas didn't look any different.

Are you for real?!\\n\\nSo my friend and I are scoping out all the Chinese restaurants in Madison, and this one was not impressive. Although it looked promising when we arrived because of how many people were here, we quickly learned the truth. This place ... is whack. I ordered my go to - cashew chicken - and my friend ordered one of her go to's - fried rice with beef - and we were both NOT impressed. Second bite into my chicken, and it's HARD. Like BONE hard. Eew. And my friend's fried rice had so much egg in it, it took up a quarter of her plate after picking the egg out of a third of her dish. Like, we know protein is important, but there are other food groups too, ya know? The best parts of my cashew chicken were the cashews and the white rice - which if you don't know - are impossible to mess up. So we wait for our bill, like forever, and when we finally get it, there are our fortune cookies! I open mine, and it has the fortune sticking out, and she opens hers, and BOOM. No fortune. That's like the whole reason we're doing this. We love those fortunes. Disappointment. Wah. Anyway. The chicken was bad quality, I've had much better. The pieces that weren't hard were dark meat - very spongy. But they fill up that soy sauce bottle real good, because we used over half of it, so that's a plus. Prices weren't bad either.

In fact for the most part I don't like seafood and that may be where the problem lies. There wasn't much on the menu that wasn't seafood (this was not my choice to go here as I was with a group).

Phone orders are so customers do not have to sit and wait at a location for their food. I asked to speak with the manager regarding this and the lady said \\\"\"I'm in charge!\\\"\" I asked her to explain why I can't order on the phone if using Value Card due to it is just like paying with cash.

That does not mean you should deny a customer from ordering. Also when I told the \\\"\"manager\\\"\" I'd just pay with cash then she was EXTREMELY rude on the phone. Never have I ever ordered from a restaurant and receive such poor customer experience. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!

I had many, many choices but this restaurant's friendly and warm ambience lured me in. I sat down to a semi-cleaned table that I had to wipe clean myself. Ok. Bad. But not that bad. I was quickly greeted and offered a drink. Looking over the menu my stomach told me to go with the chicken burrito. I hadn't had mexican food for quite some time, and the restaurant was bragging that they were known for their burritos so, bonus! Bring it on. The menu read that it came with all the ingredients that you would expect from a super burrito. It was delivered fairy quickly and cut in half, which I normally do not prefer. Come on now, I'm a big boy now, I don't someone cutting my food into smaller pieces anymore. At first glance it looked pretty tasty, and then I took a bite. Disappointment set in and if it wasn't for my gross need for nourishment at that point I would sent it back and left. This large burrito had no flavor what-so-ever, except for the taste of leftover chicken that has been reheated. There was absolutely no seasoning, and one third of the burrito was shredded lettuce. Adding the accompanying hot sauce did no good either. I don't know what to say. I had another bad airport food experience, again, on this trip. And, apparently, the people who were sitting two tables away were having their own bad experience as well, so bad, that they got up and left. In the end, SEASON YOUR MEAT! YOUR FOOD! Ambience is nice but food, especially mexican, usually has great flavor, so give it to us. Now that I am home I will be visiting my favorite taco truck in Oakland where I can get a real, authentic, great tasting burrito.", "Would've given a 5 star for the new and posh rooms and almost smoke free casino.

It was a little early but the front desk assured us (4 couples with 4 rooms) that while the rooms were ready yet, they were being cleaned.  It wouldn't take more than 2 hours to be done.  All sounded fair since we were early.  Walked around in Crystal and only 1 friend got the call letting her know that her room was ready.  That was 1:30 pm.  We all went to front desk to pick up the key  with her and check on the status of the rest of the rooms.  At this point only 2 out 4 rooms were ready.  We went and chilled in the 2 rooms while waiting for the rest to be done.  \\n\\nAn hour went by and we called front desk to check the status only to be put on hold for 20 minute before being told that they were trying to connect with housekeeping for the status and will call us.

She opened the door to check and sure enough it was a mess.  Housekeeping hadn't got to it yet, and it was 3 pm.  The lady began working on it immediately. \\n\\nI went back to my friend's room next door and got a call from front desk saying housekeeping is working on my room.  Duh... I knew that.  I was the one who dragged housekeeping over to clean the room.   40 minutes later, I sent my husband to front desk to complain, and he called to tell me that he got our room key and it was finally ready.  Right after I spoke to him, front desk called to ask me if they should send my key up to my friend's room.  Duh... My husband already go the keys.  Again, that was almost 4 pm!!!  We got there at noon.  \\n\\nWhat is wrong with Aria customer service?  1) No communication between front desk and housekeeping; 2) not prioritizing to clean the rooms that guests already tried to check in to.  My conclusion is that MGM group is trying to save a few bucks by not hiring enough cleaning staff and training front desk staff properly.  \\n\\nI don't think we'll be staying at Aria any time soon until they get their act together and up the customer service standards.  \\n\\nSuch a beautiful hotel.   What a waste...", "Why didn't I learn my lesson from the last time?  This last visit to Tao reminded me why I don't like it very much.

We were trying to dance in one of the smaller rooms and the DJ was super weird.  He played some funky songs that were hard to dance to.  Occasionally, he'd place some good tunes, but then he'd repeat them for like a minute too long.  It was AWKWARD.", "My husband was looking for Milanesas. So, we came to this place since they were the only place in Scottsdale that I could find that had any on their menu.\\n\\nMy husband ordered Milanesas, with rice and beans.  I ordered a burrito and taco combo with carnitas.  The Milanesas were not cooked to order.  They were dry and brittle looking.  The meat was paper thin.  The beans were like Taco Bell beans; they were of a watery substance.  Their carnitas were boiled and tasteless.  My burrito had nothing BUT carnitas in it.  Who does that?!!They serve their combo meals with a side of lettuce and tomatoes with a dollop of mayonnaise.  Pretty strange if you ask me.  The only thing I enjoyed was the horchata.  Thaaaat's about it.  \\n\\nAfter going to a few places in Scottsdale, looking for AUTHENTIC Mexican food, I have officially given up.  The only reason I gave two stars is because the horchata was really good.

Mind you, I've already lived here 15 months and the it wasn't ever changed or cleaned before I moved in. The random fees are absolutely ridiculous as well.

I was wanting to get my nails done. It has been a good 3 years since I had and saw this place as it is close to my home and they had an advertisement in the window for a full set for $20. Upon entering the place was really clean. They had 3 techs on duty that worked at both the nail salon and the tan salon attached to it. When I first entered the lady who greeted me and asked me what I was wanting. When I told her I was wanting the full set as advertised she said she was on lunch and could not assist me but would check to see if one of the other 2 had time for me. One was doing a pedi and one was flipping through a magazine. A nice gentleman said he would do my nails. He was gentle and quick to get them done. I was in there a relatively short amount of time. They were a little longer than I had asked for, but looked decent despite the noticeable air bubble on my thumb from the gel coating. When I went to pay, he told me it was going to be $32. When I asked about why so much of a difference he said it was because of the gel coating which I was cool with. After tip total paid was $42.\\n\\n  Speed forward 4 days after I got them done and 3 of my nails were already lifting! WTF!! Acrylic nails usually last about 2 weeks or so before they begin lifting.

Upon checkout I was quoted a price of 65.63, I mentioned a had a coupon for $14 off of the oil change but was told I could not use it. I asked why and was told this particular store ran it's own special discounts and no others could be used because of it. I asked what the special was and was told it was $10 off of the oil change, I said my coupon was worth more than that and I would rather use it, I was told no. I then said okay, and mentioned my 15% off additional services that I would like to use instead, again I was told no because of the mandatory $10 off that the store had no choice but to issue.

Don't stay here - they clearly see customers as a (un)necessary evil.\\n\\nThat said, there were several friendly staffers - Candy (Front Desk), Hope (restaurant), and Saturday's morning shuttle driver and while there, the room was functional, clean and met our needs.\\n\\nThe stay began 300 miles away when I checked in online via HHonors.com and chose a great room on the top floor and called ahead to add friends to the reservation since they would be arriving earlier than I would.  The first time friends stopped by, the front desk person said they weren't on the reservation.  When they return after I added them, they spoke with a different clerk than they had earlier or I did on the phone - and were given keys without being asked for ID.  That has to be illegal (if not, it should be).\\n\\nThey go up to the room to find the HVAC unit in pieces unassembled - luckily we had a good weather weekend, but that could be a rough bump in the night going into the grate over the plastic casing of the unit.  As the stay progressed things were relatively uneventful.  The restaurant and shuttle service did an excellent job Saturday making our stay for the Pitt vs. Georgia Tech Football game a good day.  Much appreciation to those named above for making that happen.\\n\\nThis morning, we had a lot of interaction with the people who run this hotel.  At the restaurant, the Director of Food & Beverage was taking orders for the made-to-order breakfast; of the three of us, the last person's order wasn't included on our ticket.  So, one of the servers took the number from our table making it difficult for them to find us once the third person's food was ready.  So hard in fact, that they gave her food to another table that even said it was what they'd ordered.  This was straightened out eventually, but it is interesting how the staff managed a packed house the day before flawlessly, and today a sparsely filled dining room was tricky for the Director of Food & Beverage to manage.  Most staff was the same - and maybe they were tired - but it really did seem that changing who took the orders may have impacted the accuracy of food delivery.\\n\\nLastly, at check-out, I was preparing to walk out the door (which had the 'do not disturb' tag on it, and there came a knock and I said I'd be out in 5-10 minutes.  In fairness, it was 12:05.  Another knock came and I opened the door - the Head of Housekeeping was there with her clipboard.  I explained that I was hustling to get ready and would be out in 5-10 - to which she responded \\\"\"okay\\\"\" and she looked down at her watch.  When I express dissatisfaction with her attitude, she said \\\"\"sorry you feel that way, this room was marked as vacant which is why I checked.\\\"\"  To which I responded, please don't apologize for how I feel about something - please apologize for your actions.  I realize this was a bit harsh, but I didn't appreciate that this was the last impression I'd have of this hotel - and she felt it was okay that that impression be a negative one.\\n\\nHigh potential staff, but management has a lot of improvement needed.

I love when steaks come sizzling to the table, in butter or not, and I appreciate they need to stand for as much as ten minutes before cutting in, but the Donovan's steak just look like it was waiting back in the kitchen too long.

Everything else was just fine. Wine list was dissappointing. Almost impossible to go frugal, so that you can justify (2) bottles. Table for 3 was nearly $600 with tip.

The one redeeming quality is that it's half price after 10pm, but it's often packed, dark and loud by that time.

Me and my hubby came here for lunch last Saturday before I went to go shoot a wedding over at the Flamingo (which is another damn story).  The price tag was off for the food they had to offer, but there wasn't a line around 1:45, it was almost $60 for the both of us.  They didn't even have any shell fish at this price.  I hadn't been to the MGM since I was a kid and wanted to just go and see it again and try the food, which proved to be horrific.  Going up and down the aisles, I realized that a lot of the food was really repetitive, they had your fried/southern comfort food, your \\\"\"asian\\\"\" food, including teriyaki fish, noodles, sushi, etc.  They had their breakfast items, salads, veggies, fruits, desserts.  I'm pregnant, which totally multiplies my love for food by like umpteenth times, but before being pregnant I could take down a whole cow if you gave me a few hours, but this place couldn't even make pancakes that were appetizing enough.  I had these scalloped potatoes with cheese and sour cream, I believe, on it, and the potatoes weren't even fully cooked.  Phil had some fried chicken and fish items, which were not good.  I also had the teriyaki fish I mentioned earlier and the minute I put it in my mouth I had this overwhelming taste of ginger.  I had the couscous salad which tasted much like toothpaste.  Honestly, I can say that the only thing good about this place was the veggies, oh and the nachos, but how could you fuck up tortilla chips and cheese, but everything else was horrible.  They put such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't even bother getting desserts and I have the worst sweet tooth, and if anything I'm sure the desserts would've put me in a better mood.

The soups were all right, but I think I've had better from Campbell's, so I can't really give extra points for that. The pasta was cold and bland, and the bread products (except for the cornbread, which was quite tasty and moist) were reminiscent of lumped sawdust.

Being from Louisiana I was expecting the best, especially since the owner said she was raised in Nawlins. I had the oyster po-boy with all 2 of it's oysters, the coleslaw was soured like it had been made a long, long time ago and the sweet tea was slimy. Not to mention the blow-flys flying around!

The biggest disappointment were the pitas. My husband had the shawarma wrap and I had the falafel wrap. Neither had more than three pieces of meat/falafel. Both were very bland and both had reheated stale pitas. We asked for any type of sauce, and we were treated with barely concealed disdain.

I only wanted to know what she planned to do, I did not want her doing anymore damage.\\n\\nThe new hem on the jeans is rounded on the front side and longer than the back.  The seamstress used her own styling to recreate a strange look.

It was clear to me at this point that not only could she not fix her mistake, she refused to admit the mistake existed and instead offered that I'm simply uneven, and that she had no intention of refunding my $24.00.  \\n\\nI have never been so disgusted with a businesses practices in my life.  If you cannot do a simple hem evenly, you have no right running a business.  \\n\\nFor the record, I measured when I got home and they are uneven.

Well, the cat scan showed that my appendix had burst, they ran with me to the operating room, atlas I was saved. My problem was with the hospital room they had me in (437-A) It was  filthy, I was hospitalized for a total of 5 days and not once did anyone from the housekeeping staff come in and sweep, or mop or even empty the trash.

I don't think I have ever had such an oily piece of cake. So that was disappointing. But I already bought it so I ate it anyways. The frosting was nice. It tasted like coconuts, so I assume they use that coconut butter to make the frosting. I liked the frosting better than the cake. The cake wasn't dry, which I can assume was because of the large amount of oil in the cake, but it didn't have much flavor. And it wasn't very sweet either. \\n\\nSo that was a bust.

I am not a Korean, but I sure do know what Korean food should taste like.\\n\\nOne should not compare this kitchen with those that are in let us say, San Francisco, L.A., or NY.  \\n\\nAnd it's a good thing my friends also weren't Koreans;  none of them knew what the dishes should taste like.  I was fortunate in that sense.", "I should have listened to everyone who told me to go to XS. I came to marquee for my birthday & it had to be the worst night I've ever had. The entire staff was rude, except the shot girls. They were too damn strict, its a club, let people have some fun & they stopped letting people on the dance floor, so if you left your friends there to go to the bathroom don't expect to go back to them. I decided to go to surrender the following Wednesday and had the best night. No matter what others club I've gone to, surrender has always topped them & their drinks are $13 at surrender & $20 at marquee. So take my advice, save your time & money & go to wynn/encore. Marquee is overrated!!! I will never go back there!", "Food was ok.  Their menu prices online are not their current prices.  Also, watch out for delivery fee they charge without telling you, we paid $7 on top of our bill, thats more than what 1 entree cost!  Hot and sour soup was watery and tasted like it came out of a can.  The crab puffs were good, but didn't have any crab in them.", "I was surprised. The food looked really good from afar, but it didn't taste very good. The food was bland, and missed a lot of oppurtunities to be an excellent dish. The burger patties were small and dry, and the Bleu cheese on the burger was more of a bottled dressing than the delicious sauce that was advertised. The pulled pork pouting was mediocre, the sweetness of the pork and slaw didn't mix very well with the generic fries and gravy the poutine offered. The onion rings were good but weren't worth the 6 dollar price tag. Service was excellent, however. Overall it was an OK experience, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it and I won't be going back.", "the bakery is okay but the service is terrible; went in on Saturday to pick up a cake I paid for and ordered on Tuesday; Waited 40 minutes and then when they finally got to me they said they had not started on the cake yet! I waited 40 minutes and there were only 2 people ahead of me. 3 employees walked by and did not aknowledge the wait; They told me to come back (too bad I pre-paid for the cake) and did not apologize, just went to the next customer; there are much better European bakeries in N.

We ordered BOURBONZOLA which was dry and tasteless, TUSCAN CHICKEN PASTA we sent it back to the kitchen because it looked like it had been sitting around for days and CHICKEN AVOCADO SANDWICH which was okay.  We will not be going back any time soon.

We went several times to Renegade based on our past experience.  Each time, the food was innovative and tasty.\\n\\nYesterday, we invited two friends to join us for a 7:00 p.m. dinner. We arrived at 6:55 and it was evident that the hostess was a bit frazzled. The bar area seemed full but there were lots of tables in the restaurant area and only two patio tables full.\\nAfter waiting about five minutes or more, we were seated. No menus - apologies because they were out of menus. Then the next clue came - the table next to us - got up and left after we had been sitting for about 10 minutes and finally received menus. Two glasses of wine took another 10 minutes. Water came right before that. The wait person said the kitchen was understaffed. Not a good sign.\\n\\nTwo larger parties had been waiting with children. Their food finally came. Wait staff came to tables with food and then left because they were at the wrong table. Our order went in about 30 minutes after being seated. at 8:15, someone came by after my husband pointed out we had been sitting since 7:00 p.m. He said that they were \\\"\"slammed\\\"\" and our food would be out in 10 minutes. 8:30 no - food - only two glasses of wine and iced tea (had asked for hot tea) - we left.\\n\\nFood had been good the previous times, but the disorganization with the wait staff and kitchen isn't a good sign. When we left, there were very few tables full in the bar. The patio had maybe 5 tables full. This is a sorry state for what was a pretty innovative restaurant. We won't likely be back.", "We've ordered (most often for delivery) from Jade Palace several times a year. Sadly, with each order the quality seems to be missing the mark. The owners of Jade Palace are very supportive of our children's school, so it is very hard for me to write a derogatory review. Our order tonight ($70.00 - really HIGH) was edible, but tasted awful. Every item, shrimp, orange chicken, pot-stickers and especially the noodles were all greasy...very greasy. It was a very disappointing meal! Perhaps this was a fluke. But I have my doubts. Our last order was greasy too. Maybe your meal will be as good as we used to enjoy...several years ago. Jade Palace is worth at least one experience so you can make your own decision. We all have a different taste, particularly when it comes to oriental cuisine. :(", "So maybe I'm not a big fan of the Navajo or Native American foods that I've tried since moving to AZ.

Cabo has generated a lot of hype, but does not have the substance to back it up.\\n\\nGiven that it was a Saturday night, I assumed there would be a bit of a wait.  We were told we'd have a table in 10 minutes, and the hostess was pretty accurate.  After initially getting our names on the wait list, though, she could have done without immediately telling us we were in her way (in those words, exactly).  We made it to our table, and the waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink orders.  We inquired about the specials on the chalk board, only to find out those were from yesterday and no one got around to updating the sign.  We placed our orders from the regular menu.  And waited.   And waited. And watched other tables, who were seated AFTER us, receive their orders BEFORE us.  Mind you, half the restaurant is still empty.  After 45 minutes of waiting and inattentive service from our waitress, she explained there was a mix up in the kitchen.  She was unable (unwilling?) to compensate us in any way for such poor service.\\n\\nThe food finally arrived and I was unimpressed.  It tasted good, but not Food Network, everyone's-talking-about-it good.  The tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland.\\n\\nWhen you add it all up, and factor in the fact that the place is so loud it's impossible to do more than look at the other people at your table, I felt like I had wasted my money and the better part of my evening on a miserable experience.  Needless to say, I won't be giving Cabo a second chance.", "It was okay Boo for upping  the price shouldnt it be cheaper if you come later ?not as nice as X/S located  in the same vacinity  as Surrender but it was okay.

To get my wife a congratulatory bouquet for her new office.  \\n\\nAs soon as I walked through the door, I realized I was in a floral thrift store. I was greeted by a stark showroom filled with dusty baskets and props that looked like they belonged in a family photo studio circa 1981.  The two small refrigerators they did have only had 4 bouquets in them, and the flowers appeared old and wilted.  The employee pointed to the cooler at what I believed to be the \\\"\"Charlie Brown Christmas Tree\\\"\" of floral arrangements and informed me the arrangements start at $45 and go up from there. \\n\\nThe employee did rise quickly to greet me, she asked if I needed help.  I inquired about delivery, and they do deliver, which is nice.

I couldn't even make up a lie as to why I needed to leave, I just blurted out \\\"\"I'm going to try somewhere else\\\"\" and turned and walked out.\\n\\nI ended up going to an unnamed local grocery store in Charlotte and a florist working in the smallest little corner of the store made me a really large arrangement with fall colors for around $35.  This was definitely a case where I wanted to support local business but the product they offered completely underwhelmed me.  \\n\\nTodd's Flowers has a good location with some really nice Elizabeth homes nearby, but they need to work on the customer experience, and they need to have someone cranking out beautiful arrangements that you can't find anywhere else in that area.

The meat and produce sections are lacking quality.", "Oh My Dear God...I don't even know where to begin. Let's start with one word: horrendous. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I needed a place to eat and stay for a bit since we were just leaving the Mr. Olympia competition held that the New Orleans Hotel and Casino. Since the taxi and shuttle bus service was unbearably long we decided to be a little dangerous and cross the street in the pouring rain to this bar. After looking up the yelp reviews and seeing that people liked this place, we went in. I was immediately punched in the face by the awful smell of smoke and my ears bled immediately due to the bartender's foul mouths. There were three bartenders: Jason, Chris (who was female) and some other man who looked super stressed out and had a cold. I counted 31 times they said the F word. I'm not saying I'm prude or offended, I just think it is super unprofessional. \\n\\nWhen we walked in we sat down at the bar where there were about five others sitting. It took a bartender 13 minutes to even notice us and another 15 minutes to actually get us our drinks (which I refused to drink from the straw since the female bartender \\\"\"Chris\\\"\" was using her hand to wipe away her runny nose continuously). \\nMy boyfriend was hungry; however, we were so hesitant to order food from this place! We waited forever for someone to come by again after our drinks were given--the standard is to give drinks and provide a menu, hello?! We had to ask the bartender Jason if their kitchen was open and he pretended not to hear us until my boyfriend stood up and called out to him, then replied with a short rude \\\"\"ya.\\\"\" Due to the cab wait being over an hour he went ahead and ordered a chicken sandwich. This took about 25 minutes to come out. \\n\\nAs we were sitting at the bar I realized that the food was being placed right next to the registers when it was coming straight out of the kitchen. This is NOT good. The chef or runner was placing the food plates next to the dirtiest place in the bar--restaurant rule NEVER place food near money. GROSS. \\n\\nAlso, I believe the manager was there as well. I wanted to so badly confront him. However, he may have had a heart attack since he could barely breathe and move about the bar. I figured I'd save my own breath and just get the hell out of there.\\n\\n*Note: There were a lot of regulars. If you are not a regular you will be ignored.

He kept telling me not to worry about the cost of the frames and handing me $280 ones that are well over what my insurance pays. When I told him I wasn't paying for frames, he just walked away. Then when it came time for me to check out, my eyes were still dilated for the final exam from the Dr., he told me I was free to go. I said to him, I still have to see the Dr. NOT GOOD!!!

The techs were fine, etc.   BUT, the front desk staff is horrible.  It turned out that the test was going to cost @ $230 up front, which surprised me as I have never paid anything up front before besides a small co-pay.  Other imaging places always billed the insurance and then billed me for anything that remained.  Not this place.  She called me up, and abruptly (almost rudely) said, \\\"\"How are you paying for the $230 copay?\\\"\"  Those were literally her first words to me.  No explanation of what this cost was for.  No easing me into the fact that I needed to hand over hundreds of dollars 4 days before Christmas.  Basically no people skills at all.  I needed the test, so I paid the money.  Later, I went back up and asked what the charges were for and she basically blew me off and said to call my insurance company.  \\n\\nThe whole thing left a VERY bad taste in my mouth.  I wanted to leave, but they already had my money.  I've still not been able to figure out why I was charged that much, and up front.  I'm waiting on my insurance claim sheet to come back to me and hopefully that will explain it.  But, the reviewers on here that had issues with incorrect, almost fraudulent billing are making me even more nervous.  Even if it's billed correctly and I did owe that money, they made me feel like the money was all they cared about and that I should just 'pay up' and shut up.  I'll never go back to this place, even if the charges were correct.  It's not worth feeling like I'm getting screwed over and having the added stress of their bad attitude during an already stressful illness.  Someone needs to train those front desk workers -- they're an insult to the public.", "I had a terrible time ordering flowers through this service.  I had ordered Christmas flowers for my grandmother to be delivered the day before Christmas.  When I spoke to her on Christmas day, she said she had not received any flowers.  I called FTD the next day and got a lady that was very difficult to understand.  She put me on hold and confirmed that the flowers that I had ordered were not delivered - no apology, no explanation, and no attempt to correct the situation.

I had to insist on talking to a manager in order to get what I had already paid for.

I too was left wondering where the waiter was and whether he forgot about us or not. My friend ordered the Gyro and it did not come with the usual toppings that you experience at other places, lettuce, feta and tzatziki. When we asked for tzatziki, it took forever for the waiter to remember we had asked for it, and we were charged for it. I did enjoy the white sangri however, which was very delightful.", "So I've been going to the  first Hotn'Juicy and wanted to try their 2nd location. Their food was on point, just as good as the original spot. But I was disappointed by the service. Server was complaining that we were ordering too much. The place was not busy so I didn't know why she was in a hurry. Second, she accidentally knocks over my beer all over me and the table, which is ok cause it was an accident. I'm a server myself so I understand accidents happens. But she just stood there watching me to wipe down the spilled beer all over me and the table. On top of that she was laughing about the situation. Ok I understand maybe it's your first day, maybe tired but at least pretend your apologetic, and help a brotha out cleaning up. Thirdly, she never came back to the table to either bring more napkins, or perhaps offer a new beer! No one came down to our table except to deliver our food. We had to wave another person for another beer. No one checked back with us or anything. Our check was $130 for 3 people. We left $20 for the service that we didn't get.

Another thing that upsets me about this location is that on my last few visits I have found that the only registers available for check out are those of the self-help variety.

First off, the wait was incredibly long and strenuous. My group and I got in through a promoter who had a comped table. But the Hakassan people overbooked tables that night, so we ended up not getting a table after an hour wait. Once inside, I felt as if there was nothing special about the club. The dance floor was too crowded for life. You were constantly being pushed against another person and tiesto had not even come on yet. In fact, I left before Tiesto came on because it was too crowded, the drinks were not good and too expensive ($18 for a vodka red bull), and it just really didn't seem worth it in the end. Lastly, like every other review mentioned, there are way too many stairs. I thought Marquee was bad. I definitely will not come back to this club in the future. It is way overpriced, overhyped, and not worth the money. I think I'll stick to XS or Marquee next time", "Eh.  Meh.  Amateur Veg cooking.  No salt.

Of course had to wind our way through the casino to the bank of elevators to get to our room.  When we got to our room, the door was ajar and someone else was in the room.  They had been waiting to get moved to another room.  The front desk moved us too--to a room on another wing. Dragged those suitcases some more.

So I kinda feel silly because it is bar food, so maybe I shouldn't be so harsh? I came primarily to try the poutine fries, but of course also ordered a pizza. We placed our poutine fry order, and it took 30 minutes for them to come out, it was a small order and we were the only people in the dining area. Our server was always coming around checking on us, so I know it wasn't her fault for the delay, so we couldn't really figure it out. Was a little strange to get your app at the same time as the meal. As for the pizza, it is Sicilian style (rectangular) which I'm not a huge fan of because I like crust, so you have an entire mid section of pizza that is all alone because I eat around it. We ordered half margherita and half back home. When the pizza came out it looked good, but as I got a couple bites in, it started to taste gross. They bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of putting it on after, so the basil is wilted and burnt, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese was gross to look at after 15 minutes, it became hard and formed, and the crust had an overwhelming taste of yeast, clearly not quality ingredients. Again, I realize I'm at a bar. My stomach has been a little upset since I ate. The two things this place has going for them is the Pandora station they play and the poutine fries, but I'd never come back and wait 30 minutes for them.", "All banks conduct legalized fraud, but PNC does it under the radar.  This review has been a long time coming, but unfortunately, you won't care what I say until it happens to you. :)  Let's start with ATM's, you wanna use one?  Then you better use a PNC or an extra $2.50+ fee will be added on top of what ever the other ATM charges you.  That's right, lets say your in Tokyo (only 1 bank in the heart of Tokyo will accept your card anyway,  all others will fail ) and they say $5.00 fee (in Yen), well PNC will tag on their own $2.50+ just because they can.  What dicks you say? well let me also say another thing about international travel.  DON'T USE YOUR PNC CARD INTERNATIONALLY.  PNC uses Visa which they decided to set a 3% charge too.  So spend $100 PNC will take $3, ON EVERY PURCHASE.  My previous international travel bank Fidelity has since sold out, but before they only charged a 1% fee.  Before you laugh and giggle about pocket change then picture this.  International at that you can only pull out up to $200 from, sub-track 10% (3%+ ATM Fees) of that and realize that it goes directly into the pockets of your financial institution, of which your money is supposed to keep afloat while they rob you blind any which way they can.\\n\\nSheetz ATM surcharge free?  Think again, Sheetz won't charge you, but PNC will.", "I had been eyeballing The Cupcakery for several of mine and the girls at work's trips to Chipotle for lunch and finally HAD to go in... The store was super cute and noone was at the counter... As I was browsing the flavors the cashier came up and very impatiently asked \\\"\"what can I get for you?\\\"\" in a super snobby voice like I was sooo bothering her... She kinda followed me down the counter (it's not very long so I felt very rushed in this important decision) and I asked her about a particular flavor named \\\"\"Bugs\\\"\" or something similar... It had a cute caterpillar piped on top.. and the cashier looked at me like I must be sooo stupid and says \\\"\" It's carrot cake\\\"\" in the most condescending tone EVER! Needless to say I did not pick Bugs... So sorry Cupcake Girl that I didn't make that connection and you didn't really make me feel welcome to read the description...I went back to the office with Oh My Gosh Ganache and found myself munching on what seemed like a strofoam peanut with a dollop of crisco in the middle... I didn't finish it... That's never happened with me and a cupcake before... Not even the ones in a six pack from the grocery store!!! Lucky for me I found Retro Bakery, whose cupcake are fantastic and they are super friendly to boot!", "Doesn't even deserve one star, but negative stars, only!!!  My first and last experience was indescribable.  My husband wanted fried rice, only.  They don't have ANY rice. He ordered nothing.  I ordered, what I thought was hot soup.  It was a cold, bleh!!!  It also had some type of bones (I, hopefully, assume for flavor) which I didn't know was in the soup, so when I spooned it up and tried to eat it, obviously,  you cannot.  I had to spit it out.  A plate of bean sprouts????????  I didn't think I was ordering vegetarian soup.  My sister ordered another type of soup.  Hers, at least was hot.  We have eaten all over Las Vegas and tried hundreds of restaurants.  This is the worst experience and food, ever.  How do they stay in business?????????????", "Wow!!  This place has gone down hill!  The pretzels and cheese that used to be free are now $10 for three pretzel sticks. When we asked the server, Tayler, why they are now charging for bread he said \\\"\" we are trying to run a business and people would come in, eat the free bread sticks and then leave\\\"\".  I stated maybe they should give the bread after the order is put in. He stated \\\"\"you know our rent is $250,000 per month\\\"\".  My thought, you can't argue with stupid. They also removed the truffled fingerling potatoes, that was my favorite, from the menu. We ordered fish and chips and sliders. The fish and Chips were $30 and are only average. When some of us were done with our subpar meal the bus boy began removing plates and reaching right over my plate as I was still attempting to eat. I suggested to him that maybe he should wait until we are all done.   Tayler, in all his brilliance, decided to come over and tell us that the bus boy was the best they had, blah,blah, blah. In a nutshell Gordon Ramsay needs to bring kitchen nightmares in to his own place and Tayler, you need to learn that the customer is always right and to shut your stupid mouth.

I don't care if it's a Chinese buffet, Vichy, La Stanza, or the Pizza Hut lunch buffet! \\n\\nThe food is just okay. But the wine is 3 - 3.5 times the SAQ prices! Seriously!!! Who wants to pay $43 for a $13 bottle? It's flat-out insulting.", "Not too bad for a sushi-to-go place. The pre-packaged rolls are pretty bland w/ tons of cucumber and avocado rolls. If you want some fresh sushi, I suggest taking the time to dine-in instead. The ramen was below average for a $10 bowl but it's a mall sushi place after all. Their \\\"\"designer sushi\\\"\" was pretty interesting. Tried out one of their Hako sushi and it was actually pretty good.\\n\\nThe only complaint I have with their prioritization skills. I group of 4 ordered the 60-piece giant platter right before me during the lunch rush hour. Just b/c those people were fine with waiting 30-40 min doesn't mean the rest of the people in line were fine with it as well. They ended up assigning all 3 sushi chefs to making the giant platter instead of doing a 2-1 split.

Saw the reviews but figured I'd give it a go anyway.  Grabbed 2 rolls to go so I could go back to my hotel room and work.

Pretty disappointing overall.", "So I really wanted to like this place, I had read the signs about a Camp fire Ceasar and all.  And I did really like the cheap drink specials 6 bucks for a pbr and a jameson after 10 pm.  But what happened to me and a friend here tonight will serve me to never go to this establishment ever again.  We were talking at the bar about various things and I found out that our conversation about Americans being fat due to a lack of public transportation was completely forbidden.   My friend and I were just sitting at the bar when all of a sudden the bartender tells us that we need to leave, now I have been wasted and told that I would not be served any more, but his was entirely due to our conversation and our something or whatever with positive body image.  Instead of trying to argue with us, our bartender suggests that we drink our drinks fast or get a refund.  WTF?!?  This is the kind of bush league stuff that you only hear about and never experience in real life.  The poutine was great, as were the drink specials but woe be to you if you mention anything to do with fatness, or you will be asked to leave.  My friend and I are still confused several hours later.  It is enough to cause you to wonder whether prejudice against lesbians is justified (which I doubt is actually their goal in life) but being  unwelcome as a straight man is a new experience.  I will never go back and will be frequently any of the various other bars in Montreal as a result.", "We drove around Tempe Marketplace looking for Mojo yogurt for a good 10 minutes, trying to pinpoint its exact location from the Yelp map and directions.  We finally decided to ditch the directions and get out of the car and walk around the outdoor mall to find it.  We spotted a family eating out of Mojo containers and asked them for directions.  Just down the way, near Kabuki.  \\n\\nTempe Marketplace is really cool!  I'm from Colorado and so the outdoor mall thing hasn't exaclty caught on (going shopping outside isn't exaclty appealing when it's freezing).  Since it was nighttime it was nice to sit by one of the fireplaces and take in the palm trees lit with colored lights.  \\n\\nMojo was okay.  Why is it so dimly lit?  Why weren't there more than 6 chairs inside the place?  I was expecting more flavors than 6...they do provide tasting cups by the yogurt machines so you don't have to be rationed on your samples (a plus).  The sugar free blueberry was good, as was the \\\"\"white boy vanilla\\\"\", but I decided on cheesecake and cookies and cream.  The mango wasn't good...dairy free and kinda blah...They have a selection of toppings, but don't expect as much of a variety as Yogurtland.  I'm still looking for a REALLY good alternative to Yogurtland (and Pinkberry has yet to come to Arizona...sad)...Mojo just wasn't it.", "This is a Lunch Review:\\n\\nFirst I'd like to start off with stating that I'm regretting giving this place only a two star review. But the final reasoning for the lower score is because just like Dawntawn Pittsburgh, it's a very forgettable experience.\\n\\nLet's start with the pros.\\n\\nDespite Friday's being a popular dine out day, the restaurant was only comfortably full. I personally like this, it allows for a steady flow for the waiters and bartenders and I don't experience anxiety sitting on top of somebody else.\\n\\nThe hostess was pleasant and ready to help me to a table, but as it was only me, I took a seat at the bar. The bartender came over unrushed, but promptly and handed me my customary water with many lemons. It's still a workday so I was disappointed I didn't think to glance to a drink menu, despite a really attractive, well stocked bar. He handed me a menu which displayed a decent lunch selection. I hope this is a shortened menu for lunch hours, if I were displayed the same selection for a dinner time, I would call it limited. The bartender was also prompt to stumble through the three daily specialty dishes. I say stumble, as the menu is doing it's best to read in the finest (worst) pittsburghese the city has to offer. \\n\\nStruggling with the same hurdle, I chose the devonshire sammitch. This item turns out to be a slice of butter fried toast stacked with lots of shaved turkey meat, a couple slices of bacon and smothered (!) in what looked like nacho cheese sauce. It looked or tasted nothing like I expected it to, which turns out to be a good thing. The sauce is homemade and not oversalted, and though it looks like it's overpowering you soak it up with the mounds of meat you are given. It was suprising one of the best tasting lunches I've had in a while, especially for a lunch. Also, I had to eat it with utensils. Suprise! With a pittsburgh theme, I was expecting something to pick up with my hands. (happy me)\\n\\nThe bill was unrushed, my plates were cleared quickly and the bill was decent. (tada 10 dollars)\\n\\nNow what made the review go sour: The atmosphere.\\n\\nThis place has an identity problem. It's called a tast of 'Dawntawn' so you expect it to be almost over-yinzered. Disregarding the menu for a second, i don't know what downtown their talking about, but it's not Pittsburgh. First, it's NOT decked out in black and gold (jaw drop).; second - it's looks like it was decorated by three conflicting interior designers, trying to mesh a roaring 20s ideal (from the giant mural on the wall to the martini etc alcohol posters opposite it) with fifties diner accessories (the fries, if you order them, are served in miniature fryer baskets and there is a oversized set of cutlery mounted in a corner) and waiters that are dressed injapanese steak house chef jackets. Everything (!) is RED: the countertops, the walls, the lights, the placemats, the menues. Red on red on red. The single exception is the hideous awning on the outside of the building.\\n\\nAll together I was so dizzy trying to figure out what the impression of Taste of Dawntawn is supposed to have on me, that I will have forgotten it all together by tomorrow. If not by the end of the History Uncorked event in 3 hours. \\n\\nSo regrettably, despite the actually good food, I have to knock down the review to \\\"\"Meh\\\"\" as I will probably not be returning to the location.", "A group of ladies and I went out for a social dinner on a wednesday night.  The service was ok, I ordered a gin and tonic tall with extra lime.  I got an anemic \\\"\"tall\\\"\" (ounce wise could not have been more than 8oz.) with one lime.  Had to ask for the second one which took a while.   ordered the ribs with the cole slaw and sweet potato fries.  The sides were delicious. The sweet potato fries were a little sweet with the extra sugar on them, but I ate them all!! \\n\\nThe ribs, hmmm.  They were a hair on the tough side and extremely small.  The bones were maybe 2-1/2\\\"\" long.  Then there was a huge strip of fat along one side of the rack.  Overall, very expensive for just ok food and service.", "For my daughter's 1st birthday, we decided to get our cakes at Robert's based on the high rating it has here on Yelp.  Today, I picked up the cake, quickly observing the baby's \\\"\"smasher\\\"\" cake, and not the main cake.  I was not blown away by how it looked, but if it tastes good, then I could easily forget it.\\n\\nI brought the cakes in and wife opened them to check them out.  Immediately, she said, \\\"\"What the heck, is this nuts?!\\\"\"  The outside of the normal sized cake for my family and my 8 year olds to enjoy had some sort of crushed nuts rolled all around it.  My wife was furious, but decided to give Robert's a chance, and called just to make sure that we had been given the correct cake.  The conversation proceeded as such:\\n\\nWife: Hi, my name is Kim, my husband just picked up our cakes, and I was calling to make sure that we got the correct cake.\\nBefore she could even explain what the issue is, whoever answered responded:\\nRobert's: They are just pecans, no one is allergic to pecans, there is no problem.\\nAgain, my wife didn't even state that she was calling because of the outside of the cake, which is suspect.\\nWife: When I ordered the cake, he didn't say there would be nuts on it, and I asked for plain, simple vanilla.\\nRobert's: I understand that, but they are just nuts, don't worry about it.\\n\\nIf my wife had made a stink over the nuts, I can understand the gentleman's attitude, but to preemptively dismiss an error in the making without admitting some sort of fault is just poor business.  Maybe I could forgive the issue if the cake turned out to taste awesome, but my 8 year-olds, whom the cake was intended for, do not like nuts.\\n\\nRobert's will not get any further business from us, and we will be sure to let others know that they are not pleasant to work with.  For $40+ for a cake, the disgusting attitude that was given over their error is definitely not acceptable.", "poor service rounded out with poor quality pizza make this a place to stay away...\\n\\nnot recommended... \\n\\ngo to a pizza hut or dominoes near by because this place will leave you spending 45 bucks for 1 awful pizza, 24 soggy wings and a wilted salad", "So I realized this is the \\\"\"hot new club\\\"\" in Vegas, but, trying to get in felt like a bad stereotype.  \\n\\nI'm not usually one to pay huge cover charges, but, I am an amateur aerialist and was told by several locals that I absolutely had to check this place out for the shows.

Longer than I ever would have waited, but, I was a bit fascinated by the sociological experience happening outside the club.\\n\\nWhat did we witness in the meantime?  Several couples being totally ignored just trying to even check in, large groups of men being let in - but not women, people being let in with jeans and hoodies seconds upon arriving, and, my favorite, when a guy asked about the cover (and inquired why it was $40 on a Wednesday), the bouncer started screaming at him that he was Vegas and he should not be wearing $10 shirts and trying to go to clubs.  Classy.

THE SERVICE WAS AWFUL!!!\\nWe had to wait over 30 minutes....no big deal,  it was the week of SEMA and we expected to wait for lunch.  Once we were sat we had to wait 10 minutes before we saw our waitress.  We asked the hostess twice if she could send her over.  Then,  she had attitude,  like we were annoying her.

These are people who make your day and have brought a smile to my face whenever I've had a bad day. I would hire any number of them at any time. I have driven past other locations just because I enjoy the atmosphere and staff at this location. No longer. Their most recent management change has left the place without a soul.

The price for the 1/4 chicken no sides is on $4.20! For only $4.20 I'd take the chicken over a 10 piece Mcnugget any day.  The flavors were there. The spices that the chicken was marinated in really penetrated down into the meat, but sadly the wing on my chicken was dry and I found it very difficult to chew through the tough wing meat. \\n\\nMoving on to the tilapia salad my tilapia was not plated on a bed of lettuce but instead was served next to the lettuce . All the ingredients of a salad were there, lettuce, tomatoes , cucumbers , cheese and protein but there was no harmony. It was just a handful of lettuce next to a piece of fish. \\nI asked for a to go box the waitress forgot.

Generally speaking I find most of their meats to be on the dry side and sometimes even cold-ish. Not sure if they have trouble timing thier butts and brisket or just do one batch of meat a day then keep it barely warm? The smoky flavor is always there and the sauces are good enough, just seems to be lacking freshness and expertise, cooking time wise. \\n   I went for a quick lunch today with a co-worker and had the burnt ends(Smoky brisket chunks)and the fries and salad. I think I actually go here more because I like the thick-ish friesand crisp side salad and high quality blue cheese dressing more than the meat itself which is kinda sad for a BBQ place. Again the flavorful burnt ends were kinda cold and certainly been sitting a while. This is not a dish that is gonna be fresh and juicy but Ive had these at many superior BBQ places where they retain a bit more moisture. \\n The service at Memphis is always quick and rock solid on my visits. Just wish they'd pay a bit more attention to the important thing...the meat.", "I was here for Memorial Day weekend with friends. I felt like I was dealing with an airline on a transcontinental flight. The line was ridiculous even though we had a table reserved. Once we finally got in we had to wait at the bar while they sorted out our table situation. It turns out the the regulars had come buy and they had oversold the tables. I guess that was ok since it meant not waiting in line for 3 hours.\\n\\nI've been to many night clubs and I'm told this is one of the best on The Strip. I thought it was pretty average, the girls thought they were cooler than they were and most of the guys were posers trying to hard to look cool.\\n\\nThe bartneder even \\\"\"lost\\\"\" my friend's credit card, claiming she never served him which resulted in an argument where he had to leave to go get a manager. Apparently the hotel is NOT affiliated with the night club and he had to wait in line with a hotel staff member for an hour to get back in. He then had to pay cover again!\\n\\nShe finally \\\"\"found\\\"\" his credit card and the next day he had hundreds of dollars of charges that weren't his on it. \\n\\nI think this place has too much hype built up for tourists living outside of their means and trying too hard to impress girls that have no brain and no class.\\n\\nThe music was really good and I did meet some social people but I won't bother going back here again.", "Two stars because they allow dogs. Great start.\\n\\nIt goes downhill from there. This place has a great location. A cool hip vibe.\\n\\nAnd they can't stop tinkering with their service or menu. They had incredible salads. Then they downsized the portions. Then they changed the salads. Refills on their amazing iced tea were free - now they are $.50?? This was the final straw. Who the ---k wants to stand there and dog $.50 out of their bag. Or - oh better yet - let me run a $.50 charge on my credit card. \\n\\nI really hope they find something that works and stick with it. Key word is works because it's so obvious there is some knucklehead partner investing here who should not be involved. That's all I can think. Because they have everything - dog friendly, great patio, cool interior - and somehow they are ---k--g it up?\\n\\nYou know the worst part? I was so annoyed by the refill price, I stopped to yelp.

Even the dinner roll saw the inside of the deep fryer! I so wanted it to be good. Very sad it wasn't!", "I am not suprised to see other very bad reviews for Comcast.  They are shady and unreliable.

However, every month that part of my bill is different...usually more expensive.  I intend to cancel it because they cannot even tell me why it changes.  \\n\\nNow onto the staff in the Urbana office.  They are the worst bunch of customer service representatives that I have ever seen.  They are slow, unfriendly and usually just flat out rude.  Last time I was in there the lady just kept complaining and saying how she needed a nap.  She repeatedly yawned in my face while I was trying to explain what I needed from them.  If you have ever been in there you know who I am talking about.  The whole staff is so terrible.  If you have any other option for internet/cable service go for it.

She had a difficult time with the menu items and was late with refills however she was very friendly and her attitude was great. \\n\\nI had the sausage pizza and it was very disappointing. The crust ends were burnt and the bottom crust was very thin and very soggy. It was so soggy that you couldn't even fold it. It just fell apart like a wet paper towel. \\n\\nMy wife had the fennel sausage pasta. The pasta was tasty and we both loved the thin breadsticks. \\n\\nOverall for the money and the Wolfgang name and being a Phillips Place restaurant, it was a bit disappointing especially for the money.

I would go somewhere else.  My soup was descent, but the other two meals delivered to our table were so pathetic that we didn't eat them.", "I had the Sushi Deluxe.  Which was a 9 piece of sushi and a tuna roll.  I asked for Eel and they added it in for me which was cool, since it wasn't part of the usual 9 pieces.  The sushi itself, though, was tiny.  Each piece was about half the size that you would get at a better sushi restaurant like Andys, Chaya, or Sushi Too.  For the same price I could've gotten twice the amount at a little better quality.  The fish wasn't too great and two of the pieces were very chewy and kinda gross.  I like cheap sushi, but this isn't cheap enough to justify its poor taste.   I give it 2 stars due to the size of the rolls and the amount of food I got for 17 dollars.  I'm not too picky about my sushi, but really I'd rather spend the same somewhere better or less at a real cheap place like Sushi Boat in oakland.", "Can I give 0 stars?  No?  Ok, then I will give my review of this awful location I decided to give a second chance, because everyone deserves that, and was reaffirmed that this is an extremely poorly run business. They definitely need a lesson in CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  First of all a couple years ago I was diagnosed with Celiac and needed to be on a gluten free diet. I was still craving the Bobby and so I ordered it just with no bun. I was then told they don't sell turkey by the pound, I needed to go to a deli for that. Awful thing to say to someone who has a disease and still wants to put money in your pocket!  Turns out I do not have Celiac and am no longer gluten free. I figured enough time had passed, noticed the entire restaurant store front covered in an advertisement that they deliver so called I did. \\\"\"I would like to place an order for delivery.\\\"\"  Response, \\\"\"Um, no.\\\"\"  \\\"\"I thought you deliver?\\\"\"  Response, \\\"\"Let me ask my manager...  I'm sorry but no we aren't delivering right now.\\\"\"  Well you may want to take the giant advertisement that you deliver off your windows!!!!  Way to \\\"\"deliver\\\"\" on your own business model!!  BLACKBALLED!!!!", "This was a disappointment. The food was nothing special. It was salty and heavy. \\nWe were a party of four and we all felt Ill the next day. Great setting for drinks. I would not eat there again, I'm not that picky.  I actually makes me sad to leave this review. The state of restaurants in Phoenix is pathetic.", "All these negative reviews on here are absolutely right. I would have picked 0 stars if I could. Let's just dive right into this, shall we?\\n\\n-I'm moving out in a month. If it weren't for me getting my mail one day and mentioning that I was leaving, I would have never known to sign their 30-day notice before leaving, otherwise they'd charge me the month-to-month price which was ENORMOUS.  \\n\\n-My ceiling was POURING water constantly where the air filter is. I had to switch out bowls and pots around the clock because they were filling so fast. I even had to leave work to pour out all the water. Oh, and I put in TONS of work requests to get it fixed. If you want anything fixed around there, call the emergency line - twice. I submitted 3 online work requests, called twice, and finally after about 3 weeks, they came and 'fixed' the problem. I say 'fixed' because about 3-4 days ago, it started leaking again. It's unreasonable that they couldn't fix the problem the first time, or even when I asked to have it fixed in the first place.\\n\\n-Bugs. When I first moved in, there were ants. Now there are fruit flies. And I just cannot get rid of them. No matter how much I clean, these bugs just won't go anywhere. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that I never got a screen door AND the lock to my back door was busted before I moved in, so bugs found an easy way in. Neither of which were fixed/replaced, by the way. Thank goodness I live on the second floor, otherwise I'd feel even more unsafe...\\n\\n-It's loud. You can hear EVERYTHING that's happening outside. Dogs barking, kids screaming.. even people just walking around. If you want peace and quiet, this is not the place to go.\\n\\n-There is a gate at the entrance, but I'm pretty sure that thing NEVER closes anymore. How safe is that? What's the point of having a gated entry if the gate doesn't work. I'll come back around 9 or 10 at night and it's still wide open. When I first moved in, it'd be closed around 7 or so. I should also mention that my code to the gate has never worked. If the gate does happen to be closed (which is a rarity these days), if I don't have my clicker, I'm locked out until another car happens to come by. \\n\\n-When I first moved in, one of their maintenance trucks would constantly park in my designated parking spot, forcing me to illegal park somewhere else. If you have assigned parking, you know exactly how frustrating this is. \\n\\n-It's expensive. It's not worth paying that amount to live there. Maybe if the security worked and they fixed things in a timely matter, it would be worth it, but it just isn't. You can find better cheaper places anywhere. \\n\\nTake my advice: use this place as a last resort. It's honestly not worth the stress and your money could be much better spent. Once you sign your lease, they forget you exist because they only care about getting paid. I'm glad I signed the shortest lease I could and I'll be so happy when it's finally up and I can move out next month.\\n\\nGood luck in your apartment search.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nJust received a call TODAY saying I owed $125 for cleaning and move out fees from Scottsdale Springs. Total garbage. I paid everything in full when I moved out in NOVEMBER.  I know the move out fees were paid because I physically went down into the office, they gave me my total balance, and I paid it all right there. And my apartment was spotless when I moved out. A piece of advice - leave your place a mess when you move out because they will charge you this cleaning fee regardless. So why not at least make it with your money and put them to work.\\n\\nThis place is the worst. Do not move here. Don't waste your money. You'll seriously regret it and wish you lived in a box on the side of the road. You'd get more for your money that way and the box probably won't report you to debt collectors when they 'forget' to send you a bill. I promise you that much.", "The service was good, but that was about it.  I wanted something asian for lunch and was on my way to the wonderful dim sum place down central when I saw BOGO sushi.  So, I stopped and went in.  The fish at the sushi bar looked good, so I decided to eat there.\\n\\nThe ambiance felt like it was recently something else and they just painted over it and added a fountain.  It took a second for me to be seated, but my waitress was quite responsive.\\n\\nI opened the sushi menu to see that most of the rolls were about twice the price they should be(at least for this side of town), so this BOGO was really \\\"\"you have to buy twice as much to get it for the normal price.\\\"\"  I tried to order some hand rolls, but they said that wasn't included in BOGO.  So, then I tried to order some nigiri, that wasn't included either.  I asked, why does it say BOGO sushi, and the waitress told me sushi meant rolls.  I quickly corrected her and stated that no, sushi means rice.  I probably shouldn't have done that, but I don't like misinformation.\\n\\nI was feeling kind of cheap but was really hungry so I went with the hibachi chicken.  There were many other options, and I guess I chose the worst.\\n\\nFirst I got my salad, nothing special, but not bad.  Then came my food, a nice sized plate of food.  Little bits of chicken and such with a nice sized order of rice.  Oh, it was so dry, I really didn't enjoy it at all.

I told the older lady at the register that I had a return and she said that it would take awhile and asked if she could ring up the two customers behind me first.  I happily said yes considering that they each only had one item. After she rang them up about 4 more people were behind me.

The guy at the front desk gave us a nice in depth tour explaining nearly everything you would need to know about the gym; however, once we finished the tour, I felt like I was being attacked like a little 4 year old in a pedophile's van. We were brought into a small office where the employee was pressuring us into buying a pass before we had even stretched or worked out! When we had decided to leave, the employee also made a big deal about us not deciding to buy a membership. Clearly, all they care about is making money.\\n\\nAnyways, more about the gym... They have a room where people lift weights and simply put, that room smells like a donkeys butthole. I normally enjoy free weights, but I think I was smacked by a wall of testosterone when I walked in, so I just turned and went upstairs instead. Most the gym equipment is spaced VERY tightly so if you're claustrophobic or don't enjoy crowded areas, this is not the place for you. I'd have to say the only perk to this place is that the gym equipment is nice and very well constructed (from a civil engineer's standpoint). \\n\\nSimply put, if you're on the fence about coming here or don't enjoy the smell of butthole, I would say avoid it, but if you have a good amount of friends who already come here and you can stand the stench then join at your own risk.", "Our daughter finally moved out of this dump of an apartment at Mission Springs.

I chose this place because the Yelps were acceptable, and the Groupon was a great price.  When I got there, there were only three shades of tint to chose from.  They were mounted on glass on an interior wall instead of an outward facing window, so there was not way to get a true idea of what they would look like outside.  There were no examples on any cars on the lot.  The color choices were limo dark, medium, and a light, which Chris said wouldn't make that much of a difference.  So by default, I chose the medium.  To that, Chris told me that I would have to pay an additional $75.  While deciding what to do, I heard him make a repair deal with another customer for a special \\\"\"cash\\\"\" price.

The room itself is pretty to look at it.  It's not the kind of the place you'd want to live in, not unless you're a complete dbag, because that's the kind of interior decorating that's going on, but for a weekend in Vegas, it's what you'd want/expect. \\n\\nThe off-strip location isn't bad, either.  I know that's a problem for a lot of people, but if you don't mind a 6-10 dollar cab ride, then you're golden.  Place is quiet too!  Can't hear anything through the walls.\\n\\nSadly, that was about it in terms of Pro's. \\n\\nTHE CONS!\\n\\nToo many to list and describe in detail, so I'll hit you with the major points. \\n\\nI had booked two connecting suites in which I was told there were four beds.  They didn't bother to tell me that two of the \\\"\"beds\\\"\" were actually \\\"\"queen\\\"\" pullouts.  I say \\\"\"queen,\\\"\" because they're not.  I'm 6 feet tall, and when I tried to lie down, my legs hung off the edge over a foot.  They did absolutely nothing to fix the fact that they had lied to me when they booked, so I ended up having to tack on an additional suite.\\n\\nThey moved us to the 51st floor so that all three suites would be next to each other.  Unfortunately, when the last of my party arrived, they sent them to the 31st floor.  \\n\\n-The rooms they moved us to on the 51st floor REEKED of smoke.  \\n-There was a VOMIT STAIN on the carpet next to the bed.  \\n-The AC in the living room didn't work.  \\n-The jacuzzi tub jets would RANDOMLY turn on\\n\\nAlso, we were told that we would be on the list to get in to any of the clubs, VIP access, blah blah blah.

There is no reason that ANY hotel employee should yell at a guest, especially when it's unwarranted.  I laid into hotel management about this - their response?  We'll take 100 dollars off your bill. \\n\\nI would have gladly paid that 100 bucks and have them send up the housekeeper to just apologize.  When I asked if the maid would come up and apologize to my wife, I was told, \\\"\"absolutely.\\\"\"  She never came up, and when I inquired about it again, I was told the housekeeper had already apologized. \\n\\nUnbelievable. \\n\\nDo NOT stay here - unless of course you don't mind being lied to, belittled, staying in vomit stained, smoky accommodations, and all in all treated like garbage. \\n\\nWould do ZERO stars if I could.  WORST hotel experience in Vegas.", "It seems that there are brunch people that don't mind a bit of chaos, while there are also those that prefer a bit more structure/order.  LGO caters to the former, while I am a member of the latter group.  Blasting this place would be unfair, since it's just not my type of brunch place.\\n\\nObjectively speaking, there was a ton of people there and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Parking was an f-ing hassle, as others have expressed.  The kitchen was rocking it, though.  The dry goods and wine selection seemed worthwhile.  Can't comment on the food or coffee...it was all too much to deal with, and had to get the hell out of there before I could order anything.\\n\\nIf you don't mind the high-energy brunch scene, this place is probably pretty good.  If you do, you might want to skip it.", "It's okay, You kind of get what you pay for. This hotel is located at one of the end of the strip so you would need to walk kind of far if you want to go to the other hotels/casinos. \\n\\nService: \\nI experienced horrible service with this hotel. \\nRegistration check in girl wasn't rude, but she clearly didn't want to help us check in. \\nCocktail waitress -They aren't as pretty as the ones from Wynn or one of the bigger/better hotel. Most of them are kind of rude and are only looking for tips. But there are a few that I experienced that were pretty nice and friendly. \\nMaids - They don't really clean your rooms. They kind of just push everything aside. There were two days were they took the towels and didn't replace them. So we ended having to call the lobby for towel to take a shower. No big deal... Just a inconvenience.", "Gorgeous place, definitely feels comfortable. Everyone was walking out with wonderful hair, except for me. Kayla didn't listen to me. I told her how I wanted my hair. My hair looked like it did when I entered. Kayla was a nice girl, she just needs practice cutting and styling thick hair. She complained more than once my hair was tooo thick.

In fact we had to go somewhere else to get a drink to wash it down because we both felt sick after.  I had gluten free pancakes and he had French toast with eggs and bacon.  The pancakes tasted like butter, tap water and soap.  By far the worst food I have eve eaten.  The horrible aftertaste wad even worse.  The scrambled eggs tasted like chlorine , and how do you mess up bacon??! There were no people there, which should have tipped us off, the floor, table an chairs were sticky and gross an we had to ask for new glasses because our cups were visibly dirty.  The new ones tasted like soap.  We barely ate any of the food even though we were starving, and then that crap cost us $25! I will never go back here!!

Don came to my home to evaluate my saltwater tanks. 400 gal fish only and 200gal reef. He told me my tanks were in bad shape and in order for me to correct them \\\"\" from the poor service\\\"\" I had been receiving It was going to cost me about 800.00$( he recommended I replace my live rock in my reef tank... due to cynobacteria)   and then a monthly service fee of 250.00. Which was to include water changes, coral bleaching, acrylic cleaning etc. (I provided RODI water AND salt mix that was a set up in my guest house garage for easy access for him)  In the six months  he \\\"\"serviced\\\"\" my tank... I use the term loosely.. I lost 13 fish. Including a beautiful 4 foot zebra eel.  When I ask him why I keep losing fish I would get a pitiful response of \\\"\"I don't know, I AM the one people come to for these types of problems\\\"\"  To make a long story longer... I realized he had not  been performing the customary water changes that are required for aquariums. And seriously doubt he check my water chemistry.  I then checked my water chemistry and found my nitrates off the charts.  He claims he was the one who heroically brought them down from the previous service company... which incidentally did not kill my fish.Seriously doubt it as at least the other company kept documentation.  Don is dishonest and lazy. He will do the MINIMUM to your tank... clean the glass and maybe change  a filter!  I say dishonest as I gave him 60$ to replace the UV filter bulb on my sterilizer. Which he then said the new bulb \\\"\"blew\\\"\"  and I probably had a short in my 2 year old 400$ sterilizer. He then insisted I didnt need a sterilizer. Really?? ok?? Well I replaced the bulb after he was let go and low an behold my sterilizer works. The sad part is I should've and wished I intervened sooner for my fishes sake.  I just feel I one SHOULD NOT have to supervise a person you have hired to to a job.  Lesson learned for me because apparently you do.  However... doubt it would have mattered with Don from Crystal Coves Aquariums!", "Warning, I only went once, and this is only for the Terrace at night. But hands down the worst rap music and worst IPA beer ever.  Went in the evening and was blessed to have actually found a free parking spot right across the street.

As I piled into the back of the shuttle, and watched it fill up, I thought to myself, \\\"\"This must be a popular place.\\\"\" Boy was I wrong. As we all lined up for check in (half of us out the door), the front desk announced that they only had one computer working and it would take some time. I was number 7 in line. As I made it up to the marble counter and said hello to the person checking me in and the 4 others who were behind the desk, I noticed that \\\"\"old\\\"\" smell..... You know that smell that makes you think mildew? Mold? Nope, it was the natural perfume of the entire building (at least the parts that I was in). I was given my room, and I walked in and noticed a GIANT stain on my recently redone carpet, the light fixture was leaning to one side and falling off the wall, and my AWESOME view was a giant satellite dish and what looked like some rusted out shacks in the parking lot.\\nSo I grabbed the remote and was greeted by a bunch of back buttons (the numbers had been worn off). The only one I could read was MENU and it did not work. After figuring out which buttons did what (Thank God I did not end up accidentally buying hotel porn!) I started trying to change the channel. I could change by using the button to look at the next channel up or down the list, but if I hit a number, it would simply sit on the screen. If I wanted channel 24, it would first show channel 2, and after hitting 4 like 5 times, the 2 would be replaced with a 4 and it would sit there until I turned the TV off and turned it back on.\\nThis hotel was a lot like the Monday Night Pre-Season Game I was watching... Not inspiring confidence. After calling down to the front desk and asking for a 7:30 shuttle and a 7 am wake up call, I eat my delivered dinner (I dare not try the hotel's food) and set the Hilton Clock in my room for a 6:45 alarm.\\n\\nThe next morning I woke up on my own at about 6:50 to my alarm clock blinking because the alarm was going off, but the alarm itself was broken. As I walked towards the bathroom, I noticed 2 pieces of paper under my door. It was my bill, but you would not know it. Usually Hilton family hotels print everything (including your bill) on company letter head so you know where it came from. These bills were simply printed on white copy paper. If this was not a metaphor for my whole experience, I do not know what would be. This place does not live up to the Double Tree standard. Not Going Back.", "Just an awful restaurant. My order was incorrect and I was overcharged. So then after waiting forever in line I get to the window to find out I'm being charged for stuff I did not order! Geeze! It was so frustrating I had just gotten out if work and wanted to grab good and go home! So after trying to explain my order for the third time I was just fed up, so I told the guy that I didn't want anything that I would go somewhere else and proceeded to drive off. He sticks his head out of the window and yells \\\"\"NEXT TIME DONT SMOKE BEFORE YOU GO ORDER FOOD!\\\"\" Seriously the nerve! I had just worked a ten hour shift this guy was way out of line and highly unprofessional! Who hires these people!?

The only pluses I can think of are the location and the decor.  Lovely patio.  \\n\\nWe stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered three rolls.  We requested all rolls to be made with soy paper instead of seaweed - a common request that has never been an issue at any other place.  Two rolls came out just fine... the third?

I didn't know you didn't want seaweed...\\\"\"  Really?  You didn't know that is why we made sure we ordered all three rolls without it?  And then, even after having to wait another 15+ minutes for a newly prepared roll to come out... they didn't give any kind of discount for our trouble... oh no... they actually just re-rang the bill to make sure that they UPcharged us for that soy paper.  Fail.  \\n\\nWe won't be back.", "Arrived here around lunch time and the place was charming, but was completely empty. There wasn't even a waitress anywhere in sight. We seated ourselves and a couple minutes later the waitress came out. At first I thought why is this place so empty, but I would find out soon enough. The waitress was moody and gave us attitude when we asked her questions almost as if we were stupid for asking. We had a living social coupon and no where on it did it say that we had to order from the dinner menu, but apparently that was the case. We ordered our food, Cuban sandwich, mussels, arroz con pollo, and a salad. It was good, but not great for the prices we were paying. Just as an example the Cuban sandwich is $15...I think I paid $6 out $7 for a really good Cuban sandwich in Miami. Sad to say I probably will not be going back.", "$28 resort fee......Yes that how I'm starting this review because our lovers' suite was on sale from $250 to $112 PLUS a resort fee of $28, which was news to us. That's over a 20 percent increase over the real cost that we thought we were paying. Suite had view of air conditioning units and drapes wouldn't open all of the way because of building pillars, drapes opened up 15 feet, not 40 feet. The bathroom smelled of smoke on a non smoking room and floor. Called and told them, they sprayed, but smelled came back and perminated restroom. I had a much better experience at Ballys in a normal room. Beach was packed and annoying because people would leave there towels on the chairs and vacate so you would never know if the chairs were open. Music was a perfect addition and water was refreshing.

No salad bar at all.  They bring you a side salad instead.  If you are used to Fogo or Texas de Brazil, thus doesn't compare.   It is $45 for all you can eat meats, but again, no massive salad bar.  If you do t care about the salad bar, you will enjoy it.  Meats are good.  They even have roasted garlic bread on a skewer.  If you are looking for a traditional churascuria with a nice salad bar, I would skip it.   But if you are all about the meat you will like it.  Nice wines also.  Not cheap, but not outrageous either.   A bottle if Louis martini for $45.  All being said I would not return.", "This location is dirty and run down.  I felt unsafe in the parking lot.  The shopping carts are in bad condition.   The checkout lines are always long with maybe 3-4 registers open at a time.  The last time I was there it was so bad I abandoned my cart and left the store.", "The club was likely okay, but it reminded me of how old I am. I bought two tickets to see Ice Cube, which I was reluctant to do because it was a Sunday night and I work early. But the ticket said the hours of operation on Sunday was 8pm - 12 am. I thought it seemed short, but I reviewed the club's Facebook page and the same information was shown. Accepting the information as accurate, I thought Ice Cube would probably come on around 9:30 or 10, play for an hour, and then end. As I was getting ready to leave I again consulted the ticket and found a dress code that stated no hats, t-shirts, shorts, or sneakers. So I dressed accordingly.\\n\\nWe arrived at the club about 8:20 and the line was stretched down the sidewalk. No one entered yet. I get the false creation of a line so that it looks very busy and causing people driving by to want to stop and see what's happening. But it was chill and I knew I would be tired by the end of the night. Plus most of the people in line were middle aged white people, so they were just as old and just as tired as me. Finally we get in about 8:45. A DJ is playing and people are mostly just standing around. It was spacious with two VIP sections surrounding a dance area. We stood on behind the VIP on the ramp, but eventually security told us to move because it was going to be crowded. It wasn't crowded yet. I attempted to order a drink - my wife likes Smirnoff Ice. They didn't have it. She asked for a pina colada, but they couldn't make it. I said just make me something of whatever you can make and ended up with some watermelon cocktail that was okay. I ordered a coke, and it was $10 for two drinks. That's not too bad.\\n\\nWe went back to waiting. Apparently there were multiple DJs. I honestly couldn't tell because it all sounded the same to me. Most people were just standing around, but a few were dancing. My thought was why pay to go to a club to listen to some guy play songs on the computer when I could do that at home or in my car? But again, I am old. 9:30 came and went, as did 10, and 10:30. No Ice Cube. I was thinking it doesn't leave much time if they close by 12. Next a large crowd of people came in and filled the VIP areas and dance floor. I thought now we are getting somewhere, but time marched on. I scanned the crowd and noticed at least 20 dudes wearing caps, t-shirts, and sneakers. Getting frustrated, I asked the security guy what time the show was going to start. He said by 12, to which I asked curiously I thought they closed at 12. He said no, it is actually 2...despite the ticket and the Facebook page saying otherwise. Then again the dress code apparently is just a suggestion too. I started calculating in my head - 12 o'clock to start, probably play for an hour..that's 1...then drive home, probably 1:45 and then 2 before I got to bed. Getting up at 5 would really suck. I have wanted to see Ice Cube for a while - I was an original member in the Lynch Mob fan club...but alas work called, and said screw it, and we left at 11:15 with no Ice Cube. \\n\\nI am not sure why information such as hours of operation and dress codes are printed on tickets if they are not accurate. It sucked that I didn't get to see Ice Cube, but I guess $40 to realize the club scene is well behind me was money well spent.", "My wife and I had a rather unpleasant start to our evening on Saturday the 2nd of August.  We arrived early for a movie and witnessed a couple security guards harass a couple kids.  They were standing with a sign that said \\\"\"Free Coke for a Hug\\\"\".  People were going up to them and taking pics etc... not big numbers... one or two here and there..., pretty random.  \\n\\nNonetheless, you'd expect there was a greater chance of drawing attention of the security...  looks like they really got their moneys worth!  You would have thought these guys started a fight... there were patrons coming to their defense and this one older whited haired guard was clearly escalating the situation by yelling at everyone and being offensive.  He was far from professional and I'm sure he didn't like his \\\"\"authority\\\"\" questioned.  But threatening to rip the kids sign etc.. it was going too far.  \\n\\nI walked up and simply asked, excuse me, what's your name?  He said, Why? and I told him I'd like to know it so I could include it in my letter to his company.  He said \\\"\"Jim\\\"\".  Ok... Jim... then asked why?  I said, \\\"\"I don't like you\\\"\".  Because, I frankly don't !!  He said \\\"\"I hope you never have any kids\\\"\"... which i thought was funny... (I have lots of kids...they don't get into trouble...but I understood his sentiment) \\n\\nI would say, in his defense, there was a lady that he was yelling back and forth with that he clearly offended... she overstepped her bounds however and threw soda on him.  Uncalled for and it shouldn't have happened... again, the escalation on the part of the guards shouldn't have happened either.", "ALERT!!!\\nMy husband and his friend had a foot long chili dog yesterday and both of them got sick.

The turkey breast dry. The salads were messy. The sushi rolls tasted \\\"\"off\\\"\". And to add insult to injury we were seated in kiddie land. Why? We had no children with us. And we were seated where all the children (I counted 12, with different families/tables, under the age of 5) were going ultra sonic. There were plenty of tables available elsewhere. We pointed this out to the hostess who pointed to a table....2 feet away. Duh. Very annoying experience. This buffet was much better in 2004.", "I'm not sure what to think about this place. The first time I ordered, I got a french dip and it was pretty good. But today I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty bad. It tasted a bit soil-y, like the lettuce was unwashed.

I had a caprese salad - mozzarella was perfect as were the greens & balsamic dressing but the heriloom tomato was rock hard.  Nice idea but try to eat green tomato as one of the main features of a salad, not so good.  Shouldn't they atleast try to serve a partially ripened tomato?  I mean someone had to hack through this rock to put it on the plate.  Burger was good, nothing spectacular - accompanied by a side salad loaded with onions and some funky version of their bleu cheese dressing (lots of pepper).  \\n\\nOur waiter was so-so.  One of those guys that doesn't write anything down and doesn't remember anything you specially requested.  And forget about returning to the table to see how everything is after food was delivered.

I might go back if I were in the area again - if only for the patio experience and I'm not particularly hungry.", "It's great gelato... but WAY over priced. I think I paid $6 for a single scoop of gelato. The most I've ever had to pay. I have to admit that it was really good though. Cocolini is located in the Venetian... appropriate I think.

The place wasn't too busy, and their lunch menu is overpriced for what they serve.

The hot dog was alright. Nothing near as good as say Pink's (which is also located in Planet Hollywood). It was big and thick and loaded with all the toppings. The chili was meh.

I did not want to bother anyone but if I am going to be eating something - and/or feeding it to my child, I would certainly like to know what the heck is in it. She let me know that the Tomato soup has Red and Blue Food Dye. Seriously Paradise??? Have they never seen the studies that Food Dyes are dangerous for kiddos? It is really frustrating when businesses advertise something that is seemingly healthy-ish (don't get me wrong I assumed there was some cream) - but really they are throwing scary additives.   Moral of the story - visit the local restaurants who make things from scratch, and don't need to dye their tomato soup to make it red.

The chips were salted VERY inconsistently - some chips didn't have any salt and some would burn your tongue it's so salty.  They are also very stingy with the sauces - they only fill the cups about halfway with the salsa, guac and queso.  The flavor of the salsa and queso weren't bad but the guacamole was basically a hacked up avocado with a few tomato pieces in it.  Bland.  \\n\\nThe sandwich wasn't the worst, but was hard to eat.  The veggies are arranged on top like its supposed to be open faced and the shape of the roll also makes it kind of ambiguous.  I tried both ways, eating open faced style and tucking the veggies inside and biting sideways but either way its kind of messy.  Anyway, the meat is barely seasoned at all.  An au jus or some kind of aoli sauce or really ANYTHING would have helped it a lot.  The mac and cheese wasn't bad.  The sauce got a bit chunky when it started cooling off but otherwise the flavor isn't bad and they didn't overcook the pasta.\\n\\nSo the food was not awful but not very good and at about ten bucks a pop, I'd rather go to about a million other places so I think I probably won't be back.

One of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is its people (friendly conversationalists score the highest marks), consistency in food and general overall treatment.  Went there today to meet an old colleague of mine.  Ordered the mac and cheese as I thought that was good last time I had it (I must have had my places wrong, I think it must have been the Garage, across the street).  I think they changed the mac and cheese recipe.  IIf I liked it before, it tasted pretty plain and uninteresting this time around.  I had five bites and sent it back.  The waitress seemed perplexed, and went about her way.  Thereafter, I ordered the Chicken \\\"\"Vings\\\"\" which were pretty good, but not really amazing or anything to write home about.  While I was drinking my drink, I noticed there was a large crack in the glass and I told my waitress about it (yes, that is a serious safety risk).  She brings me back my drink filled up at about the 1/4 level (which was less than I even sent it back with).  If a place is that CHINTZY and feels that way about THEIR CRACKED GLASSES, then it is not the type of place I will go back to.  A classy place would have apologized for the inconvenience at the very least.  instead, they wanted me to feel stupid for raising the point. Later guys, I will take my business to the whining pig around the corner, or the the garage.

I was literally ONE MONTH away from being over 2 years ago. So in that case they agreed to the new deal service with me verbally and included the NFL Ticket as well because it was so close.

Today they told me it was not possible to get channels like that but yet I have proof that shows those channels clearly recorded in my DVR so, how is that possible then Direct TV?? Then while I was there I thought I would verify my NFL Ticket as the season is almost upon us and guess what?? That's right NO NFL Ticket folks. They claim it was never part of my agreement and it was never discussed??

I was there a few minutes later than most of the group so they had drinks already. Our waitress came right over and took my drink order - a water to start. We all started talking about the book so we were a little slow to get a food order together. She came over and asked a few times and we finally ordered. We had probably been there 30 minutes at that point. \\n\\nIt takes a good while for the food to come out and we don't really get much drink service in the meantime. She might ask one person (they probably had to flag her down) and then would leave without checking with anyone else at the table. I was able to somehow convince her to bring me a pint of Fat Tire. Not sure how that worked out. Although, someone ordered a shot and was brought out not really what he ordered. When the food comes she brings two other people's order, but not mine. I figured she couldn't hold them all or it was a few minutes behind. We don't really see her for another 30 minutes or so. We finally flag her down and I ask her to cancel my order. She looked all surprised and seemed like she tried to blame it on some guy. No apology, no nothing. \\n\\nWe received crappy service the remainder of our visit. We asked for separate checks and she brought over one long bill. One gal took it up to who we think is the manager and asked it to be split out. We ended up getting separate checks, but my drink and another girl's fries were on the same bill. Really? Ugh. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but was just the gross maraschino cherry on the top of a melted sundae. \\n\\nYeah, the Olympic hockey final was on, but it wasn't busy at all before that and we still had bad service. We determined they don't like blondes. I'll pick a better sports bar before I color my hair. =) \\n\\nRecap: Worst. Service. Ever.", "I just landed in Phoenix for a few days, and since this is my very first time I wanted to kick it off with some good food.  After looking around on yelp, I found that this promising restaurant is in my very own hotel, so I figured what better way to start my trip than with some nice smoked meat.\\n\\nThe pulled pork on the menu seemed like the thing for me, but as I was talking to the waiter he mentioned that their burger was just voted the best in Phoenix.  I asked and he said that they grind their own meat.  So, never being one to turn down a good burger, I figured that would be a great start.  After the fact, I realize the fatal flaw in my plan was that I never asked if Phoenix was known for it's burgers...\\n\\nI ordered an iced tea, and a burger (rare) with an over-easy egg on top.  Here are the details:\\n\\nFirst, the iced tea is not very good as far as iced tea goes.  I asked the first server (not my waiter) if it was fresh brewed before I ordered it, and he said yes.  However, what came was a cloudy, bitter, iced tea that usually indicates that it came from a mix, or concentrate.\\n\\nSecond, my first burger arrived (yes, first).  Normally, I don't send food back, but it was REALLY SALTY. My lips were burning after the first bite. Beyond that, it was cooked medium or medium well.  I don't honestly know the difference when it gets that cooked.  It was chewy though.\\n\\nThird, my second burger arrived.  It was seasoned well, but still overcooked.  It was dry and chewy.  Even the egg didn't make it better.  Maybe it would be good for someone who likes their burgers more well-done.  The bacon was good though.\\n\\nOverall, I think they probably pre-cook their burgers and then heat them up to serve, as that would explain why they can't cook them to order.\\n\\nThe service was good.  I liked my waiter, and the manager did ask if he could bring me anything else, but I learned long ago not to go for a third try.  So, the two stars is not for the service, it is for the food.", "Drive thru issues and rude manager. \\nMy order was wrong and there was no cars in the parking lot.  So Im not sure what their issue was today. When I made the complaint and asked to speak to the manager. She didn't care what I thought and dismissed me completely. She even rolled her eyes at me.\\nI have been a customer here since the 1980s and have never been treated like this.  \\nThe food was as good as it always is. I recommend you avoid the tyvola location..", "Seriously overpriced. I had the veal chop which was good, but Capitol Grille charges less. My dinner partner had the Shepard's pie which had a muttony taste. I didn't care for it.\\n\\nOur waiter was a bit of a retard. First he forgot to bring a Pepsi which we needed to fix the horrendous Long Island iced tea we made the mistake of ordering. Then he told us the fountain drinks were completely out. \\n\\nHe spent more time gossiping in the back of the store, and not enough time watching the levels.\\n\\nReally can't recommend this place.", "Grand Cafe? A Grand price for mediocre food. \\n\\n I have to say that I was disappointed with the cream of mushroom soup,spaghetti with meatballs, and Pepsi. First off, I believe with a strong conviction that Grand Cafe ought to include a soup of the day or salad with the meal. This isn't the Las Vegas Strip! And if the soup or salad is $3, I feel ripped off considering that the Cream of Mushroom soup included zero mushrooms. Coincidental this soup tasted and looked similar to the Progresso Cream of Mushroom soup that was recently reintroduced to the Las Vegas market. A soup  that once had mushrooms in the broth. Fast forward to the spaghetti with meatballs. It is impossible to ruin spaghetti, but Grand Cafe came close with the meatballs. It wasn't cold or anything. Just below average. A significant portion of the plate was taken up by garlic bread. In my opinion garlic bread is filler. And the Pepsi was too syrupy.\\n\\n  The service was decent. Nothing grand and nothing negative.\\n\\n   The deal is that what I ordered at Grand Cafe was not worthy of $20. I could of dined in Red Lobster for that price. If I do return, I intend to stick to a sandwich with fries. The bottom line is that Station Casinos should bring back the value of their old Grand Cafe.", "They didn't welcome us when we came in. While we were looking at the sample nails they informed us that they couldn't take us because they were busy... They had 3 people in there. Maybe they do good work but I will never know.", "Hit & miss.   Today was a miss. Eggs and bacon both under cooked. Pecan pie was runny and glopy.", "Just one of the worst Korean restaurant in Montr\\u00e9al. I have been poisonned after eating in this restaurant. I am suspecting people working there gave me the rests or not fresh Products. In addition to this some racism issues (people are not treated the same in this restaurant)", "This place is just a rip off of the Flame Broiler down the street. Ribs are awful, chicken is fatty, and the service is slow.", "Disappointingly I can't leave 0 stars on this review. As petty as that may sound. I'm truly disgusted with the service as well as the quality of food. I am a night owl. So a must is always the mid night special. I get the medium rare steak with scrambled eggs and sour dough bread dry with a hot water (water is free). I've been coming here since I was 16 and it's seriously sad to watch such a beloved cafe become sooo poor in food quality! Service has always been terrible but never their quality of food! They always made up for the long waits with the deliciousness! But recently. Coronado cafe has dramatically taken a turn for the worst. Their steak is no longer a decent size nor does it hold the flavor a steak should, the hash browns are smashed potatoes that a baby would think is play food, and the eggs are still soggy with yolk? (I thought scrambled meant no yolk?) BUT the ultimate deal breaker was how disrespectful the cashier was. Since I get the same order every time I was baffled by them charging me 4 dollars for a \\\"\"hot tea\\\"\" (I OBVIOUSLY had my own vibrant tea package). & when I addressed the issue with the cashier she blamed me for the \\\"\"miscommunication\\\"\" due to not discussing the issue with the waitress who only delivered my food once, never hearing from her again (Dora was her name).  Correct me if I'm wrong but charging me for an item that I brought is unrealistic. & ever since when was the customer wrong? Customer service was bafflingly pathetic and inexcusable. As for a customer coming back any time soon? I am not in that category any longer. I truly hope that this cafe improves. They're losing such valuable locals. I sure won't be back any time soon!!!!!", "Another day, another update.\\n\\nYeah....Lost Leaf is just not for me.  I don't wear skinny jeans, I don't own a Mac, I don't listen to indie rock, I don't drink beer.", "This location is just TERRIBLE. If it's not the customer service that's off, it's the long wait times, and if it's neither of those, my order is wrong or skipped. When I go through the drive thru, I burn a quarter tank of gas because the shortest wait time is still 10 minutes. And the absolute worst part is the employees can NEVER be bothered to apologize for the wait or for messing up an order. If this weren't the closest location to me I wouldn't go as often as I do. I wish I could give this location negative stars.", "Meh. \\n\\nThe place is quite pretty and the menu might be appealing to out-of-towners that don't know about all the other great classic French bistro-style restaurants in Montreal, but if you've been to L'Express, Le Meac or even Cafe Cherrier, this place doesn't even compare.\\n\\nThe food here was good a few years ago, but I'd have to say that it's mediocre at best now. I had dinner here this weekend and parmentier soup was bland, the steak in the steak-frites was dry and overcooked, and the cod fish was fine but nothing to write home about. And last but not least, the baba-au-rhum dessert was watery.\\n\\nAlthough the food was a let down, our waiter was friendly and on point, and there is still something kind of nice and nostalgic about the place itself. It's the kind of spot you wish could stay good forever. But sadly, it seems pretty obvious that it's not the case. \\n\\nThere are tons of French bistro-style spots in Montreal that are WAY better. I'd pass on this one if I were you. \\n\\nSorry!", "I wish two stars meant \\\"\"fair\\\"\", because this place is not \\\"\"bad\\\"\", but it also ain't \\\"\"good\\\"\".  I will return here, because I have a car that steers itself to the Strip district, and am therefor forced to eat on the Strip at least twice a week.\\n\\nAte on a Thursday, about 5:00pm.  One other couple in the place.  First impressions, please spend a couple days, and brighten the place up.  Scrub it down thoroughly, maybe splash on some paint.  It is not dirty, but it is just slightly above dismal.  Needs more light, scrub and wax everything, and that would make the place a whole lot better.  \\n\\nI got the fried rice supreme.  I like rice.  I like fried rice.  I like fried rice that is not greasy, has a good balance of flavor, and has to has to has to have bean sprouts.  The fried rice supreme came with a skewer of about five medium sized grilled shrimp.  Overcooked.  I would guess that they were pre-cooked and then warmed up for the meal.  Same with the pork and chicken.  They all tasted O.K., as in passable, but they also all tasted like they had been cooked before, and were just warmed up and laid down next to the rice before being served.  Not bad, but no excuse for this.  All dried out.  Not happy about that at all.\\n\\nThe rice part of the fried rice was also equally disappointing.  It had a really promising taste at first bite.  Not greasy, nice texture, and a great smoky taste.  but, very few added ingredients.  No bean sprouts, some finely chopped scallion.  But nothing else.  A little bit of finely chopped egg.  Nothing else.  Rice, small amount of scallion, small amount of egg, some smoke seasoning, and the three sides of chicken, pork, and shrimp.  HUGELY disappointing.   I mean, I took the majority of it home, and am looking at it now.  Yep, those were all of the ingredients.\\n\\nThe wife got the bun with pork.  Pretty standard, rice noodles, The rice noodles were not good.  Tasteless, starchy, just not good.  Bean sprouts, juliened carrot and sliced cucumber.  Chopped Romaine lettuce.  and the pork and obligatory fried spring roll.  Now, we had ordered a spring roll as an appetizer, and had to send it back, as we thought it was burnt.  We sent it back. When the spring roll came back, it was just as burnt.  the wife said \\\"\"this tastes like burnt oil\\\"\".  Duh...  I would bet that the oil the things were cooked in was old.  Same as the spring roll that came with her bun.  Old oil leaves \\n\\nNow THAT irritated me.  The fillings in the fried spring roll were good, but there are few things as bad as anything that has been cooked in old oil.  The cook is forced to do a balancing act of cooking the thing to the point of doneness, without making the wrapper black to the point where no one would eat it.\\n\\nThe ingredients were good, but the execution was off.  Oh yeah, one last whiny comment, the fish sauce was the cheapest saltiest fish sauce I have EVER had.  I mean, I am not asking for the stuff to be that $50.00 a bottle super delicious fish sauce, but the stuff we got was horrible.  Like they had added salt to the fish sauce, which I know just cannot be the case.  So, just guessing that they use horrible cheap fish sauce.  THIS is the reason folks say they don't like fish sauce.   When it is just salty and plain bad.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was like eating at a Chinese or mexican restaurant, where they try to target a Midwest .  The only upsaide was the waitress was really nice.  I tipped her well.  I am hoping that if I go back for lunch, maybe it will be better.  If it is, I will update my review, if it isn't, I will say so.\\n\\nOh, and I am definitely not going to try the Bhan Mi (Vietneamese sandwich) that they advertise here.  I would be royally torqued off if I waste cash on a Ban Mhi here, when the Vietnamese lady who sells these sandwiches right down the street at the fire station is so close, and sells such flat out delicious vietnamese sandwiches.  She is the best!  (not really, but pretty darn good!).\\n\\nOverall, I am going to come back, give it another try.  Gonna try the Pho.  Hopefully, it will come out, the broth steaming hot, and a plate full of bean sprouts and basil and lime wedges on the side.  If I get that, I will edit this review, and give glowing remarks.", "back in 1990 this was a great fast food place-i mean the sourdough jack was something i literally wrote home about, in the 18 years since this place blows-nobody working there cares or has the ability to. this establishment has to be the leader in ada hires. the food is just wrong!! tacos are good if you need a colon cleansing, and the shakes are ok too. strangely enough the best thing on the menu is the egg rolls!!", "Felt like it's a three star place, but downgrade because everyone else is overrating it.\\n\\nCame here for lunch on Friday, pithiest way I can describe the place: \\\"\"run-of-the-mill\\\"\"  The food was terribly bland and service was average.  Prices were okay.  \\n\\nSpecial of the Day: Penne Pasta with Salmon - it was lukewarm by the time they brought it out.  Panini - tasted fine but not enough flavor.  Salad - I don't need a lot of dressing for my salad, but this definitely needed more.  Lunch takes a long time to serve too.\\n\\ndmo out", "A coworker of mine selected this restaurant as her birthday lunch destination when I offered to treat. And what the birthday girl wants, the birthday girl gets... so off we went! This was literally my First Watch - I had never even heard about this place until she mentioned it. \\n\\nThe inside is just as some other reviewers have pointed out, very cafeteria like yet still cheerfully bright. It definitely gives off a \\\"\"Good Day Sunshine\\\"\" breakfast vibe.\\n\\nWe sat down in a not so comfortable cafeteria style booth, and I began to scan the menu. The options looked decent but boring, and spanned the spectrum of usual omelet, egg, bacon, pancake, griddle, wrap, sandwich and salad dishes. First Watch also has \\\"\"The Healthier Side\\\"\" - a portion of their menu dedicated to those watching their waistline. I thought that was a nice touch. \\n\\nThe coffee tasted like warm water with brown food coloring in it, very unimpressive. I ordered the No. 5 - an Asian salad with chicken, romaine lettuce (yuck), wontons, cashews, cilantro and carrots with the ginger sesame dressing on the side. This salad was not impressive at all, and it needed more toppings to combat the bland romaine lettuce. I just picked at it throughout the entire meal. \\n\\nThe birthday girl ordered the Black 'n Blue Wrap - roast beef, blue cheese, tomato, lettuce and horseradish sauce wrapped up in a spinach tortilla. She was impressed with her meal, so maybe I should have gotten a wrap instead! However, I probably won't go back for my Second Watch to find out. \\n\\nOverall, First Watch is decent. The service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre. The breakfasty-brunchy-lunchy menu was a step up from an IHOP or Denny's because First Watch's food isn't as greasy. So if I had to compare, I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality, presentation and flavor is much better. \\n\\nIf you're looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area, I suggest you drive a little further up Central to the Park Central Shopping center and hit up The Good Egg. In my opinion, their salads are tastier and their coffee is stronger.", "A little tricky to find.  They are behind the Fossil store.\\n\\nBasically these are standard cupcakes.  They do have some unique ones (such as pumpkin spice for Halloween).  I had a double-chocolate, and it was good.  But it wasn't $3.75 good.  I could do almost as well at home (I'd just need to learn how to do the butter cream frosting).\\n\\nAs I said, the cupcake was good.  But it wasn't GREAT.  And for $3.75 it should be GREAT.

Dessert was good, we got some kind of creme brulee assortment and I got the Grand Marnier souffle.

No bueno.  \\n\\nOn the upside - we were upgraded to a \\\"\"Select\\\"\" room for 6 bucks extra each night.  This actually meant a shabby chic toilet seat.  Hooray for us!

French onion soup looked like dirty dish water and was too salty to eat due to the insane amount of parm cheese. The spinach salad actually wasn't half bad. The bacon dressing, though, did taste more like Bacos bacon than real bacon. Finally, the steaks. They were basically truck stop steaks. You know, they're good because it's a steak, but it's not seasoned at all. We used copious amounts of salt, pepper and some of our blended red wine that remained to season it up. The pasta side was supposed to be in garlic butter sauce, and I tasted no garlic. The broccoli was disgusting and microwaved. Every single table that got broccoli sent it back untouched at the end of the meal.\\n\\n\\nOther gems: You could hear people yelling in the kitchen. Watching a man in gym shorts and a ratty tshirt deliver food to the bar.  Frozen butter.  Our waitress not being able to read the wine labels because \\\"\"she didn't have her glasses on.\\\"\"", "Went yesterday. I was in the mood for a place with a good food and beer selection and this place fit the bill in theory.\\n\\nYes, they have a very nice beer selection, but the issue is their food. While nothing was bad per se. Nothing was real good either. I had the scallops and they were just ok, my wife had the filet mignon and again decent but nothing that would make you want to come back.\\n\\nAs another poster said, and I think this is the perfect description, it's an overpriced Yardhouse.", "Disgusting rooms, filthy, mattress torn, carpet so dirty it smells, sofa collapsed on one side, toilet seat broken, residents dealing drugs from their rooms, prostitution rampant.

Not a big deal, but Denny's has more class than this joint.  They have a \\\"\"vegan\\\"\" burger.....served on an egg bun.  Sharp thinking, genius chef!  Their $14 kale and spinach salad has only one vegan dressing- oil and vinegar.  Gross!  The people I was with said their food wasn't that great, either.  My wife had a field greens salad and currently can't drink enough water because something was spicy and she has an awful taste in her mouth.  Their $8 \\\"\"birthday\\\"\" bread pudding (thanks for the free candle, cheapskates) \\\"\"sucked\\\"\" according to everyone who tried it.  Awful, awful, awful.  Never again.

Maybe it's just me, but that should mean that their fish and chips is pretty epic.... this place is a complete fail\\n.\\nQuite possibly the worst fish and chips experience I have ever had. The location is pretty dingy and has the wonderfully appetite inspiring odor of a dumpster. But let's focus on the food. The fish that they have is basically a triple size fish stick; nothing special in anyway at all. It basically had no flavor other than the oil it was fried in.  The fries that the fish sticks were sitting on were good, which is why they get 1 star. Oh and don't expect any ketchup to try and add some flavor to the food, they don't carry it at all! and if you want something other than their vinegar dip, you'll be paying extra for a little cup of tartar sauce. I also ordered the onion rings, and just as a side note, I LOVE onion rings, however these are the first onion rings that I have had that I didn't finish. They were nasty, for lack of a better term.  They were so hard that it was like chewing on tree bark, coated in sandpaper with a flavorless worm in the center.  \\n\\nI'm sure that after a night of drinking and smoking this would be the perfect ball of grease to settle my belly, but if you are looking for something tasty, or something to eat when your taste buds are fully functional, this is not it.  There are tons of other places to get fish and chips and onion rings that put this place to shame.", "I live near by and visit often. I like the atmosphere. But the service really needs help. There is only one bartender at all times. For that size of place especially during happy hour. I think if they would add a bar back or another bartender this would help immensely. The wait time to get a beer or food is ridiculous.", "The garlic tomato sauce that comes with the bread is the only good thing there.  The soup tastes like it came from a bag, and the marinara sauce on my pasta and chicken was disgusting. It was sour, and upset my stomach. My mom had the cheese ravioli, which was actually pretty good, but the service here BLOWS! We complained about the sauce to which the response was, \\\"\"yeah, they make it sour here...\\\"\" Sucks, sucks, sucks.", "While the food is basic but good, service is subpar.

The woman at the return desk would not allow me to return the shirt (understandable, I had no receipt) AND wouldn't give me a store credit even though the item still had all the tags on it. The explanation from this woman was \\\"\"Target will not permit more than $75 worth of returns in 1 calendar year.

With breakfast, I had the Hog and I believe my wife had the Breakfast Burrito. The Hog was good, although I was searching for the cheese, the Breakfast Burrito however was a different story.

We thought/hopes it would be different since it had been months since breakfast (breakfast was around Thanksgiving), however one of us left hungry again. This time it was me. I had the Steak Tacos and she had a Chicken Sandwich. My tacos were incredibly overspiced that I couldn't enjoy them, although I tried eating 2 of the 3. My mouth was on fire and so was her's after a small cut of the steak. We got a check back a minute after the food was dropped but I hadn't eaten much at that point.

That about captures it. \\n\\nWe were so excited to see a new Fox Restaurant Concept open up in town. Also, we are HUGE oyster and seafood fans and that's why we were so curious about this restaurant -- especially when they have a huge oyster area up front and state they ship the oysters in fresh every day. However, there is NO WAY these oysters were fresh. They had a mushy/creamy consistency that made it impossible to want to finish them. \\n\\nWe also tried the shrimp cocktail and jar of crab appetizers. Neither one of these were disgusting, but they weren't good. The shrimp cocktail from Costco is much better than this one was and cheaper. The crab was over cooked and extremely pricey for the quality and amount you receive. \\n\\nThis place is expensive to try and not worth it.

Arrived there only to be told at the front desk that there wasn't any reservation under my name. Unfortunately I didn't have the confirmation email from priceline at that time (months old reservation) and I figured that maybe I messed up the reservation because there was a lot going on at that time. So, I ended up (from the lobby) calling up other hotels, and finding a room in Caesars palace down the street for a reasonable price (lucky!). After the trip was done, I find that I was charged for a no-show at the Westin (surprise - they found the reservation in order to charge me...).\\n\\nBut all that is understandable (once I figured out what had happened- read on - it was a technical issue in their system). Customer service is where it gets bad. I called to get that charge taken off and first there wasn't anyone available in the right department even though I called during customer support hours. Then I essentially got called a liar because apparently the story \\\"\"doesn't make sense\\\"\" because \\\"\"their process wouldn't allow that to happen\\\"\". Then, after promising to have a supervisor call me back, radio silence. Then on my 4th call (people not available, sent to different departments etc - but who is counting at this point), by accident I figured out that the reason why things got messed! Their system said I was supposed to get there on the 6th! \\nMystery solved right? Apparently not. \\n\\nI was asked to call priceline (even though the charge was from westin) and then after a call between priceline and westin, westin still refused to do anything essentially quoting their processes. Apparently the possibility that the process was not followed just did not strike them. I am still waiting for priceline to sort things out, and if they do not, then I will get amex to contest this charge.\\n\\nLessons learned -\\n1. Do not be nice at the front desk and raise a ruckus when you find your reservation screwed up. Otherwise they will call you a liar.\\n2. They aren't really trying to figure out what happened, so listen carefully to every comment they make. I luckily happened to notice (on a random comment) that the dates in their system were different from my reservation date - otherwise that would never have been brought to light!\\n3. Customer service at the westin involves making you call multiple times because of different departments not being available, or managers not being available until 10am, and managers not calling you back hours after they were supposed to.\\n4. Customer service is happy to insinuate that you are lying, and the possibility that one of their team screwed up in not following their \\\"\"process\\\"\" never occurred to them.

I had jury duty in Florence earlier in the week and ate lunch there and it was decent, even though the guy gave me 1 slice of pizza when I ordered the special that comes with 2. Forward to Sunday and we decided to take the whole family (11 people) to A&M. we ordered 9 sodas and 2 waters with lemon to start. The waiter rarely came to check on us even though the place was dead. I asked for lemon and it NEVER came. We ordered 3 pizzas (Sicilain, regualr and the fresh mozz original.) after about 50 minutes I decided to ask at the counter what the long wait was all about. The kid said they were very busy with takeout and it would be 10-15 minutes. 10 minutes goes by and still nothing, so I went to the counter and asked again and the owner? Looked at the kid who said where are my pies and as he was flipping dough he looked at him and said here. He just began to make the pizza after 1 hour. I am certain the order was never put in or whatever something similar. I noticed a couple in the back with a pizza just sitting on their table untouched. The waiter then brought them another pie and took the pie from their table back with him, apparently they did not order the fresh mozz original pie. about 4 minutes later that pie arrives at our table, we were starved and ate it. It was a total re-heated pizza, too crispy to be fresh from the oven. I realized after it was the pizza from their table. Too late, we ate it. The regular pie came shortly after and was very hot, not re-heated and not as crispy (that is the evidence the other was re-heated). about 20 more minutes go by and the Sicilain pie arrives and looks decent, but when we lifted it, the slices were totally raw underneath. I asked the waiter if they could bake it a little more. He seemed mad but took it back. He returns about 10 minutes later and says the pizza is burning, it cant be cooked anymore, should he have them take it out. I said ok, it arrived and it was indeed burnt. The bottom was still raw. I asked him to take it off the bill, again he seemed to be getting angrier. It comes time to pay (we are there over an hour and thirty minutes). I was stunned when he told me the total was $80 for 2 pizzas, 10 boneless wings and sodas. He said we had 11 sodas, I told him i drank water as did my father in law. he took them off then I saw he added $10 for a tip, I asked him to remove that as well. This guy was mad, I signed the check and put a zero on the tip line, I asked my wife for cash. He saw the zero on the tip line and literally threw the receipt towards me. I stupidly gave him a cash tip when I should have clocked him in his cocky head. This place sucks, it is FILTHY and the service is awful. The food is ok if youre into eating pizza from someone elses table and raw foods.

The man was able to get away with pushing a petite woman down while we were punished for defending her. There were many people that witnessed the altercation and attested that the man was in the wrong. With that said, the GM said that we were the ones that were wrong and defended the the instigator.

There were also no real signs directing you from Harrah's.  \\nWe knew there was still construction happening so we specifically asked to be in a room that wouldn't have construction views or noise.  Well, we were placed right outside the construction and there was a chute right outside our window that chunks of concrete and building debris were thrown down.  It woke us up at around 7:30-8 on Monday morning and was so loud we were startled out of bed thinking it was an earthquake or something.   \\nThere still seemed like other things that weren't completely finished.

I was very hesitant about staying at a hotel off the Vegas Strip. The only reason why I stayed here was because of their $59/night deal. Well, guess what? You get what you paid for.

The water supply was shut off so there was barely any running water from the sink. The shower barely trickled water so I wasn't able to shower. Worst of all, the toilet wasn't able to flush!

The chips were decent but very thin so they broke fairly easily. The salsa was their mild version and in my opinion tasted like they just pur\\u00e9ed tomatoes and that's about all. \\n\\nIt was my first experience here and after reading how it was the highest rated in the valley I guess my expectations were too high. They gave me several small containers of various salsas. One was orange - no flavor. One was green - sweet and had a decent flavor if this is your type of salsa preference. The 'guacamole' they gave looked like it had been dispensed out of a toothpaste tube and tasted average at very best. \\n\\nThe bottom line is the food was decent, not great. The prices were high in relation to quantity and flavor.

However, this location has hired some rude staff. They also apparently hate their online ordering system which I like using because I hate waiting in line. Both times i've ordered from this location online the staff member was rude, treated me horrible and made me not want to come back. The first time I ordered online I had a \\\"\"Free Drink\\\"\" and I asked her for my cup and she said \\\"\"you didn't order one, I then said yes I did it says it on my receipt\\\"\" and she replied \\\"\"oh yeah you do get one for free if you order online here\\\"\" and gave me a nasty smirk while handing over the cup. Which to me was like why do you care if I paid for it or not you'll still get paid either way.  But who knows maybe she is one of those \\\"\"I should get $15 an hour for working in a fast food joint\\\"\" employees. The next time I ordered online I was sick, all I wanted was tortilla soup and it's not like Cafe Rio delivers. So I ordered my soup and showed up at the scheduled time and I walked through the Empty line because people at tables were blocking the walkway to the to-go walkway and the employee then yells at me \\\"\"ma'am aren't you going to order first\\\"\" I explain to her that I'm here to pick up an order from online I just couldn't get through the other way and she looks at me like I'm crazy. She then opens the online ordering system and realizes no one paid attention that they had an order online to fulfill. She tells me it will be a few minutes and 10 minutes later of me standing there like an idiot in my PJ's sick and wanting to go back to bed, my small little cup of soup was ready to go. Luckily I paid by credit card online so I didn't have to pay so she just handed me the bag with a \\\"\"fuck off\\\"\" smile and didn't even wish me to have a good day.

He then suggested that I click it twice for extra extra sauce when in reality that marks and unmarks the box for extra sauce.

It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.", "Maybe someone in upper management will listen on here, Your service department at Prestige Dodge is horrible. The handful of times I have brought my 2010 Dodge Mega Cab Diesel in, I have received horrible customer service, 1st time I brought my truck in for the front bumper being loose and hanging down, I get JR Fisk as my service tech, I explain that I just bought the truck, it has 3k miles on it and the bumper is falling off. I ask that the bumper be realigned and tightened up. After a few hours I get the truck back and head home, only to find the bumper just shoved into the body and tightened. I return the truck and show them the bumper, the response I got was \\\"\"we are not a body shop\\\"\"........ That's nice......... So I brought my truck down to Chapman which wasn't much better with their attitude but did realign the bumper......... Moving forward to today, 6-2-12 I bring my truck in for a check engine light, 22k miles, oxygen sensor failure.  Jr Fisk comes up and, he says we don't have a diesel tech today...... Ok when will you? Monday - Friday, ok. Jr tells me to call 309-8000 to schedule an appointment. So I get back home and call the number, the lady at the customer service desk that was 20 feet away from me when I was there answers and puts me on hold 10 mins or so. I hang up and my wife calls back, gets put in hold for 20 more mins......... Wife finally gets pissed and drives back out to your dealership. Hopefully someone will help out this time, Why is it that your service employees have an attitude like they don't enjoy their job so it rubs off on the customer, I spent $55,000 on our truck and this is the service we receive???? My in-laws also have a dodge mega cab and have also had attitude problems with your service department.  My Neighbor Rudy has had nothing but issues with your service department and has advised me to seek out the service manager TY to get things taken care of. Why do I need to go to a\\nManger when I bring my truck in just to get a positive attitude with a little bit of communication?  Hopefully someone in management will see this and realize customer service doesn't stop at buying the car. It needs to continue into the service department. Your recording on the phone while I was on hold says your number 1 in service........... It doesn't show.", "At first I was very impressed with Window World. The sales guy was very friendly and gave us a $200 discount off of our 5 windows and sliding door. Plus their lifetime warranty was great! We ended up going with them. We were told it would take 6 weeks for the windows to come in and it did. The day after they came in we got a call to schedule an appt. We explained to them originally that my husband would be cutting a hole in our wall for the sliding door so we wanted a Monday appt. We scheduled the appointment two weeks after the windows came in on a Monday and my husband cut the hole and put up a couple sheets of plywood to cover it temporarily until the next day when we thought our windows would be installed. \\n\\nThey were supposed to be here between 8-9. At 8:30am a rep from their company calls and tells me that the installer can't come out today and they need to reschedule to Wednesday!!!!!!! When I asked why he wouldn't be out they said car trouble. I get it stuff happens. However, I told her that Wednesday is absolutely not ok because I have a huge hole in my wall and my house is not secure! She responded with, \\\"\"Ya they told me that.\\\"\" Are you kidding me?! So instead of switching someone else's appointment to get me in due to this being a little more urgent their attitude was pretty much tough luck. I told them I needed to get my windows in the next day which they did.\\n\\nThe installer who came was great. I have no complaints about the person who installed my windows. However, the next thing that happens is not only my sliding glass door 3 inches too small but my living room window is also the wrong size! He explained how sorry he was and that the person who measured was obviously wrong. He finished installing the other windows and explained to me that he would put a rush on the order for the door and window and that it would take 2 weeks and not worry about paying the remaining balance until the job is finished. Which is also what my contract says.\\n\\nWhen I call the office about the windows they wanted me to pay more money. Not just that but they tell me that the person who measured my windows isn't trained to do that. Really?! Then why was he allowed to measure them. I argued back and forth with them for a bit and tell them that what I have already paid completely covers the installation and all the windows that were installed and that my contract states I don't have to pay in full until ALL of my windows are installed properly. It took my husband getting on the phone and requesting to speak with the manager that they finally said not to worry about it until all windows are installed.\\n\\nSo I call on a Thursday to see if my windows have come in (which they did) because it has been three weeks and they say that they can't schedule an appointment yet because their general manager handles the scheduling. So at the end of the next day when I still have not heard anything I call back and she tells me the person who schedules isn't in. I didn't get a call back from them until Wednesday the following week so there's almost a whole week my windows were sitting there! \\n\\nThey finally got installed after about 4 weeks! Totaling 12 weeks from the first order! I would not recommend this place to anyone. Their customer service is terrible and they have an I don't care attitude when they are the ones that make the mistake! If I could give them 0 stars I would have. \\n\\nAgain I will say that the person who was contracted through window world to physically install my windows was great!

Gross - depressing, awful.  Let's make a deal - run!", "Introduction\\n\\nThis hotel is centrally located, but I got a ride from the airport (which by the way, is not far). There is valet parking and when I arrived, you have to go up an escalator to check-in. It appears this hotel is attached to a mall (?) or inside complex which is very convenient. My boyfriend had checked in the night before so all I had to do was go up. Elevators are near the hotel's main restaurant.\\n\\nRoom 1906\\n\\nOur room was a nice corner \\\"\"suite.\\\"\" It was sizeable and the bathroom was really huge. We didn't stay in the room that much but it was comfortable. Signature flat-screen tv, sitting area, safety deposit box, two closets (nice for extra space) and mini-bar. I wasn't too keen on the bathroom products (it said something about San Francisco) and while I usually love the smell of Lemon Verbena, these products weren't up to snuff. They didn't pass the \\\"\"Charlotte takes all the products home\\\"\" test.\\n\\nAmenities\\n\\nThis hotel has a pool, gym, and spa. The hotel site makes the pool look nice and long, which is perfect for lap swimming. But because there is so much to do and see in Montreal, my boyfriend and I hardly got to use any of the facilities\\n\\nOne main restaurant and one lounge/bar. My friends and I (we stayed at the same hotel) decided to check out this bar and it wasn't too bad. Another review on that.\\n\\nValet Parking available. Every time we wanted to go out, we had to call the Concierge to get our car ready. I had slight issues with this as every time I called, there was no one at the Concierge desk. I had to try multiple times, only to call the Front Desk to get my car. \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI came here with my boyfriend and because he is an IHG member, he stayed here for the points. Overall, I didn't have the best impression of this hotel. Nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary; it's just a place to stay. There was one day when we left at 10AM, returned back at midnight, only to find that our room had not been cleaned at all. The day before, it was cleaned at around 6pm when we were getting ready to go out. This inconsistency for me is a big no-no. Two star deductions (and no, we didn't leave the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on). Staff aren't really friendly either, but perhaps I wasn't being friendly to them?\\n\\nLocation can't be beat. When one is in Montreal, you don't expect to lounge in the hotel anyways, so really, the InterContinental is just a place to crash. But on that note, I am sure there are cheaper options if you want a just-to-crash hotel.

The bulgogi was missing the sweet marinated flavor that I was looking for, and although the meat was tender, it was a bit over-cooked. The galbi was a lot better in comparison, but again, nothing special.

I am happy to say I am still using the same phone, and there is not a single scratch on it. The invisible shield is a great product. The kiosk USED to have great service. You would drop your phone off, pick it up 20 minutes later, and maybe even leave a nice tip.  I've been faithfully coming back to this same location every 3-6 months for the past 4 years.

However while I was out downtown Friday night, I pulled out my phone only to see the front skin was ripped off.

The same \\\"\"manager\\\"\" Jay was there, except this time he was by himself. I explained the situation, and showed him my phone. When he asked for a receipt, I told him I was never given one. He didn't believe me. The old computer couldn't find my debit card in the system either, however I brought up my bank statement with a clear charge from the kiosk. He thought I was lying about ever visiting that kiosk. He lied  about the girl from the day before, and was so rude that my girlfriend wanted to slap him stupid. At this point I did not want a free replacement, I just wanted acknowledgement that I was there. He refused every time. The situation was getting out of hand so I calmed everyone down, dropped off my phone to be replaced, and left.\\n\\nWhen I returned to pick up my phone, he seemed to go through some \\\"\"change of heart\\\"\". He contacted his manager Regan who happened to be listening to our conversation. All of a sudden, he realizes every point I made to him before was correct.  Hilarious. Now he tells me that he is doing a \\\"\"courtesy free replacement\\\"\" because his manager believes I was there as well, and they appreciate I didn't cause a scene. I take the replacement, asking for a receipt. Jay said I'm not being charged so there isn't one. Very hypocritical. Any case I won't need it because I won't be at that kiosk ever again.\\n\\nAll the guy had to say from the beginning was \\\"\"Yeah man I totally believe you were here, its just our company policy states without the receipt there's not much i can do.\\\"\" The situation would have never escalated to what it was.

Reminded me of some of the shlub managers Ramsey runs in to on Kitchen Nightmares.   Another manager at the hostess station was also a waste - we had 8:30p reservations and arrived promptly, we were asked by three different people why we were waiting - including a manager, who when we said we had reservations asked if they were for 7:45p - presumably to give us grief for showing up late... but then just turned and walked away - rude!!!\\n\\nI am a huge fan of Ramsay's TV shows -  so really wanted to like the whole experience, but it just wasn't happening.

When we get there to check in, the king bed and strip view we paid for wasn't available and so they set us up in another room that had a king bed with no view, but would refund our $ we paid extra for the view back. We get to the room and this room was for someone who was handicap. Nothing against that, but the shower was different and felt like we were at a motel. So we called to asked to be moved to a different room. A dif lady at the front checked n told us a king bed just became avail. We said great well take it! Went to check in our room and it was a double queen bed. Wth. Called the front desk a guy picked up n said they didn't have a king avail n that they'll switch our room first thing when its avail the next day. Next day came we got a text saying our king bed room was avail. We go n check in and guess what? Double queen beds again! We were so furious had to call again and complain n they finally got us our room and told us they will deduct $50 from our bill. So the Last night we were there I was thirsty so decided to get soda from their vending machine. Didn't take cash so I charged it on my cc. First time it didn't seem to take my card so I swiped again. Machine said authorizing then said vending as if the soda was goin to come out. Waited a good 1-2 min. Nothing came out. Checked my bank statement n it charged me twice! Waited another min. Nothing had to call front desk and lady told me I had to go down to the front desk to talk to a supervisor. Oh man by this time I wanted to kill someone! The supervisor was nice enough to refund my $ back. This whole experience was just a living hell for my bf n I and I would never or even recommend this hotel to anyone.

I've decided I didn't need the warranty and I want to just cancel it.  I went in to sign the paperwork in the beginning of September for cancellation and they told me that they will send the signed document to the warranty company, and it will take around 6 weeks.  \\n\\nI call the dealership in November to see what the status was on the cancellation but was given the run around, saying to call back later, etc.  I went and called the warranty company myself to see if they received anything, which they have not.  Luckily I had a copy of the cancellation document and I was able to fax them the document and have the cancellation process start.  This took only 2 days to complete and for the warranty company to have a check sent out to the dealership for them to send to my lender.  I am not sure why the check couldn't be sent directly to the lender in the first place to avoid all this.  \\n\\nAnyways, I have been calling the dealer trying to get in contact with someone for 2 weeks but i'm always getting an answer machine or someone telling me to call back later.  The last time I spoke with someone(2 weeks ago) they said they needed a manager to sign off on the check and for me to call back in a couple days for an update.  I have been calling and leaving messages with no response until today, when I kept calling the finance department, where I spoke to someone who asked me why I wanted to cancel my insurance, and compared health insurance with extended warranty on a car..cannot explain this.  I just want to find out if the check has been sent to the lender so I could stop worrying about this and I get a lecture on how extended warranty on a car is just as important as health insurance?  I could easily trade in an old car for a new one, I don't think I can trade in my life for a new one.\\n\\nWhen i'm ready to buy another car, I will make sure I don't deal with the people here at Planet Mazda because once they got your money, they couldn't care less what happens after.

Made me realize that establishments that offer groupons do so for a reason, either they are new OR they are looking for patrons. Buzios is NOT NEW, so draw your own conclusion. I've been to RIO a bunch of times and didn't even know this restaurant was here. I asked how long they have been there and was told 18 years. Wow.\\n\\nOur waiter was very inattentive, we didn't see him often. Finally take our drink order, disappear.  Bring our drinks, walk hastily away. Take food order, disappear, and on and on. While we enjoying the lobster bisque that didn't have lobster in it (??) with our stale bread, my husband noticed a plate under the heat lamp that looked like what he ordered and jokingly mentioned \\\"\"I sure hope that is not mine\\\"\". Lo and behold at least TEN MINUTES go by, and yes, of course it was THAT plate that was served to him. But of course it was. It was a medley of sorts, corn on cob, crab legs, mussels etc, so while it wasn't awful and totally overlooked it truly is unacceptable. ANY reputable restaurant should have a chef that would never allow a plate to sit for any length of time like that. Being that this is an open kitchen concept, it's obvious they simply don't care. I ordered a miso glazed fish which was eh - okay. The dried out scoop of rice and the preackaged broccoli bites is what was awful.  Even with me adding sauce it was awful. \\n\\nEven with show tickets, we wouldn't have sat there any longer than possible. They offer a 25% discount with show tickets but do NOT combine discounts which is understandable. What I did find ridiculous is that they will not offer the set lowered pricing if you are a total rewards member. It's not a lot, only a dollar or two per food item , but I think they are doing a disservice to, what could be, their most loyal customers. You just lost me and perhaps hundreds of my vegas blog readers by not honoring Harrah's corporate marketing concept of discounted rates in ANY of their restaurants. Their loss anyway. Not mine as I won't step foot in that restaurant again.  \\n\\nIt's also a who's who in regards to where you sit.  Apparently the table to the left of us were never given bread, while the table behind us were the only table in the restaurant given warm towelettes to cleanse their hands.

And it is 1.99 too. The best part is the dog is not over cooked, as yours has been on different occasions. \\n\\nWhy I liked Sweet Home Chicago is that their dog was a Natural Casing and had the true Chicago Style snap that your dogs lack. It is a taste that a true Chicago Style dog lover notices. Also, as you have said to other posters, the dog you use, a 10/1 IS NOT the official size of a dog in Chicago. Most places use an 8/1.

The sushi was definitely overpriced - I would normally pay about $6 for a roll like this at the sushi counter in a grocery store.

We went on a Thursday night, around 6:00 PM.  It wasn't crowded, but there were quite a few people there, and one vastly overworked server.  While there were empty tables, we still had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (another couple waited longer), and another 15 minutes to place our order (the same other couple still waited longer).

One had french fries and one had sweet potato fires.  I had the soft shell crab and onion rings, with coleslaw.  We received our order about 20 minutes after placing it.  A beer would have made the wait a bit more pleasant, but they won't have a license until February.  My sister-in-law's comment about the crabcakes was that she had had worse (she's kind), while I thought my wife's were a bit mealy.  My soft shell crab came hot, but relatively tasteless; the onion rings might have come from the supermarket freezer, and the coleslaw was soggy (I love coleslaw) and flat.  The tartar sauce had an odd flavor, so we left it alone.  The fries, both varieties, were ok.

When we walked in, it looked like a place that once upon a time was a nice place, but it's struggled to keep up with the times.\\n\\nThen there's the service. A smarmy know-it all Maitre 'd/waiter took care of us. Don't ask him for anything that's not on the menu; he will yell at you. The rest of the wait staff looked like they walked in from the set of Goodfellas... you got the feeling that these guys had screwed up everything they had ever done so they were thrown into the restaurant where they could presumably do less damage. So we had bread thrown onto our plates and were constantly being growled at when we weren't listening to the Maitre'd berate the staff for doing things wrong. At any moment, I expected Gordon Ramsey to walk in and start filming Kitchen Nightmares, call this guy a donkey, and march him outside to cuss him out.\\n\\nBut the truly bizarre moment came when our customer (who I will admit is Chinese and her English is fair but not great) asked if she could have a salad as an appetizer. Smarmy guy got downright rude and told her no, we don't serve those. We will give you a vegetable plate. Customer looks at us quite perplexed. Our international sales manager tried to explain that the lady would like a salad, and perhaps you could prepare one for her? \\\"\"Alright, fine, since you don't understand how we do things, we'll just do this now...\\\"\" and pulls out a giant basket of vegetables and some dijon vinaigrette to dip it in. \\\"\"There, now are you happy?\\\"\"  Several awkward minutes after we had our fill he returned to take our order.\\n\\nThe entrees and soup were nice.

All dishes that required actual blending of flavors and creative prep failed.  There was also a big issue with presentation and portion.  I like small sized dishes but tonight I felt the kitchen was trying to skimp and we were eating the menu so we had lots of extra plates floating around but we all left hungry and it was not possible to share most dishes even more than a taste to your neighbor.  This killed my concept of grazing.  The worst pothole Penn Ave disaster was the Chicken Fried Mushrooms which had to have been left sitting under a warmer while other dishes were being prepared because it was lukewarm and the gray gravy formed a thick blanket of unattractive mass on top of fried greasy mushrooms.  This dish killed a perfectly good mushroom the only saving grace was that they included so few mushrooms.  The kielbasa stuffed muscles were a creative thought but the meat overpowered everything else-  I lost anything seafood except the shell.  The final stab was the slab of thick cut bacon that was passed off as Pork Belly- three parts fat is a portion that should be put aside for ingredient not entree.  The servers seemed disinterested although they were pleasant.  They never asked how we enjoyed our meal- so I never got to tell them how disappointing it all was.  If they had been any where near by or checked into customer care they could have heard or seen the reactions.  Because my company was so good I had a good night despite the bad food and I did like the more quiet setting of sitting upstairs verses the hustle and bustle of the downstairs. The metal chairs were not comfortable in fact they were less comfortable than the wooden benches downstairs. I hope Chef owner Kevin Sousa checks in because this is a really bad sign of things to come and my birthday dinner broke my culinary heart.  No espresso served here either and we skipped the dessert which I usually liked because we baked our own cake. Looks like I am taking SALT out of my diet.  Total waste of great ingredients.", "My husband and I decided to check out Lulu's for breakfast after a morning trip to Gilcrease Orchards and having worked up an appetite for a good hearty breakfast. The foyer, once you find it, is welcoming and Lulu's offers a great variety of homemade breads and pastries if that's you're thing. The ordering process was easy but I must admit, and the main reason I only give Lulu's two stars, is sticker shock. 2 small water bottles and 2 breakfast sandwiches, $18?! \\n\\nOk so I pay the nice lady and we're thinking this is going to be epic. After a short wait, they arrived with our sandwiches, the Skinny Lulu and the Farmhouse. Now I won't take away for flavor, they were delicious. But after all was said and done, I'm still hungry. Each sandwich was comprised of 1 egg and little accoutrement. My skinny lulu was served on the same bun as the farmhouse which is far from skinny and while it was tasty, again, it was one egg with 2 pieces of asparagus. Bummer man. \\n\\nSo don't get me wrong, Lulu's is tasty if you have the budget for it, but keep in mind the portions are TINY. Next time I'll wait til I get home to just make my own farmhouse with my fresh haul from Gilcrease.", "I really hate to do this, because I was personally this restaurants biggest advocate. Telling as many people as I could about this great little hole in the wall.\\n\\nLong story short, drove by one afternoon, 3-4 CMPD outside. They were then closed for a few days. Went in the day I noticed they were re-opened.\\nNo familiar faces, the cute girl at the counter who always knew what I wanted was gone, and so was the quality of food.\\n\\nGave them the benefit of the doubt to get on their feet, but it never happened.Returned 4 separate times always hoping it would go back to being great. Sub-par ingredients, all the sauces now taste almost exactly the same. It is a real shame.\\n\\nNow I have to find a new go-to take out place!! So Sorry!", "I ate here six years ago and absolutely loved the seafood selection. King crab legs the size of drumsticks and shrimp the size of prawns - all for an expensive $32 a pop - but it was worth it.\\n\\nFast forward to today and I'm back in 'Vegas for a conference.  After reading all the negative reviews of The Buffet, I had to come back and see it for myself. I walked all the way from Bally's where I'm staying just to re-experience The Buffet. \\n\\nThe price is now $40 a pop and the buffet has gone from extraordinary to \\\"\"meh\\\"\". King crab legs the thickness of pixie straws and shrimp the size of what you get at Home Town buffet. \\n\\nCount me as among the totally disappointed in this buffet.", "Not impressed. As a steakhouse regular in LA, I feel this steakhouse is an overpriced tourist trap with questionable quality and lazy service. \\n\\nSpent $200 on one steak, 2 sides, and 2 drinks! The server had entirely too many tables and we were constantly waiting on him. The sides were super small and he said you would need a couple...well, at $22 for mac n cheese SIDE (which was small), I felt robbed! Smallest steak starts at $55 and is strictly the steak...no sauce or sides. \\n\\nThe whole time I felt like I was being rationed food! Bread guy gave us 2 small slices to share! We asked for more and they never brought it. The cocktails were little and their bar was limited. Steak was just ok. \\n\\nOverall, we left hungry, disappointed, and robbed.  Stay away!", "Starting to slip. Went in for dinner at 5:00 on a Thursday. Not crowded but took 15 mins for food to arrive. The two parties before us had to return to the counter for missing items which backed up things further.  Wonder what things will be like when the snowbirds return.", "Two of my friends and I decided to go out for lunch the other day, specifically craving some sushi.  Since two of us live on the west side of the valley and the other lives on the east side, we decided to find a place in the middle.  We settled on Koi Sushi.  Big mistake.\\n\\nUpon entering the restaurant, the place was decently busy.  It is not a large dining area, but there were about 10 tables and almost all were full - I also noted there were 3 servers.  So, server to guest ratio was good.  I was greeted and told the server I was waiting for 2 more.  She then walked away.  Okay, my mistake, I should have specified that I needed a table for 3 and was waiting.  Since I was a server myself in college for 3 years, I understand how frustrating it is when patrons don't make themselves clear.  By the time the server came back around, one of my friends had also arrived and we were seated at a table.  We were handed menus and then left alone, without even asking if we'd like something to drink.  The server came back about 5 minutes later and took our drink orders.  We also ordered some edamame, since our other friend was running behind and we were hungry.\\n\\nOur drinks came out pretty quickly...and that was the last we ever saw of our server.  Our other friend showed up about 15 minutes after our drinks, and we still hadn't received our edamame.  We waited another 5-10 minutes (not sure how long, we were busy chatting) before we finally stopped a different server and asked if we could place our meal order, and if our other friend could order a drink.  We ordered our food - I ordered a spicy tuna roll and a Wisconsin roll (the menu states that it is unagi, cucumber, and spicy tuna to top it off).  I also mentioned that I am allergic to avocado, so could you please be sure to leave it off my roll.  The server was nice and told me no problem, and took our order away.\\n\\nI need to note that both my drink and my friend's drink were empty when she came to take this order.  I'm not very picky about service since, again, I did the job for 3 years and totally understand how you can get behind/swamped/forgetful.  Really, all you have to do to keep me happy is keep my drink from being empty (and I usually only need one refill).  That did not happen.  We had to ask for refills when we could grab a server.\\n\\nThe sushi itself was pretty disappointing.  My spicy tuna roll was REALLY tiny.  Maybe I am used to my regular sushi haunt, and for this reason I am spoiled?  I'm not sure, but I paid $5.50 for a very small, bland roll.  \\n\\nThe Wisconsin roll was misrepresented on the menu.  It did not come with spicy tuna on top; they had regular tuna atop the roll.  No big deal, as I enjoy both, but false advertisement is sad.  The roll itself was cut randomly - some pieces were fat, some were incredibly thin.  Weird.  The cucumber inside the roll took up 50% of the space, it was huge.  This roll was also bland and incredibly disappointing.  The roll was $10.95, which is normal for this time of roll, but the quality of the roll just wasn't up to par.  Both of my friends agreed with my assessment of the sushi - they had similar feelings about their own food.\\n\\nI also ordered a roll to go, and specified this to the server and I also wrote it on the menu.  I was taking it home to my boyfriend.  They brought it out on the plate with our food.  So, I had to remind them it was to go and that I needed a box.\\n\\nAfter all of this, we had to grab our server after sitting with empty plates for 15 minutes or so to get our checks.  We asked for separate checks, which they did just fine.  Also, we never DID get our edamame.\\n\\nThis is the first time in YEARS that I have tipped under 20%.  I felt terrible leaving 15%, but I just did not enjoy the experience.  If you are looking for good sushi on the west side, stick with Tomo or Nakama.  On the east side, I go with Stingray.  If anyone has a good suggestion for places in the middle, I'm all ears, because Koi is NOT it.", "If you want a professional looking document printed, DONT GO HERE. Quality service is terrible. Screw up an order once, shame on you, screw it up twice, shame on me...I don't know what you say after a third time. I will never come back here again. \\n\\nThis last time I was very specific with what I wanted. I asked for a full bleed. I set to normal parameters then made sure Rey understood and left. Four hours late when I came back my project looked terrible. When I said it wasn't acceptable, they said it was my fault. They knew what I wanted and when they saw a problem, instead of calling, they just ran it anyway. Then the girl helping me walked around continuing to mutter under her breath. \\n\\nGreat people you've got working for you OfficeMax!", "You know, it would be awesome if the food selection was as good as the decor. This place isn't that great. If you have kids, its  worth checking out, but other than that... ehh.. go elsewhere.", "They did a good job for a good price but it was a very frustrating experience. Called twice to confirm price but on site a totally different story. Very rude, bad attitude. Let several other customers ahead while having to call \\\"\"wookie\\\"\" 4 times to confirm earlier conversations about price. Seems if you speak Spanish you get put ahead of others. Potential ripoff unless you hold them to their word. Be carefull! Do not trust the sales guy! Tech did a good job.", "Oh boy!

Waited for 15-20 minutes for the food to show up and when it arrived we were missing my boyfriend's food. The server apologized explaining that the kitchen forgot the order (but I think she had forgot to ring it in and wasn't being upfront) and said \\\"\"please don't hate me\\\"\". His food came out after about 5min and the waitress did offer us a complimentary dessert but I was still disappointed with service because she was simply not very attentive. We watched her do sidework as we were waiting on her to come by to our table. Being a server myself I understand that there are circumstances that are out of your control and sometimes you can't give as good of service as you normally would  however I feel that we could have had much better experience had our server been more attentive because it simply wasn't very busy.", "Pizza is like art. Your dough acts as a canvas and your tomato sauce is like the paint... ok, I know, cut the crap. It's just pizza.\\n\\nMy mom came to visit this weekend and we found ourselves at the door of Fuel - the neon sign beckoning us in - so we accepted the invitation. First impression: Truck stop? Where is the gasoline smell? I mean, if they want to go all the way authentic they should just put in a gas pump. Heck, that would draw in plenty of people!\\nWe were the first ones there.. which was good because about 3 minutes later the line was out the door, literally. We each got a slice. I kept it plain, what can I say.. I'm a pizza minimalist. You can really tell a lot about a pizza place by the way a slice of cheese pizza tastes.. and this is.. average. Although I do love the thin crust I'm lost with the amount of grease. The sauce is good, not to sweet, but the cheese is sparse and knowing what you can get else ware makes it less worthwhile.\\nI'd say this would be a good place to crash in a drunken stupor but for my sober days I'll head out to Rosario's in Concord. That's a real pie.", "Because no stars was not an option. Traveled from north phoenix because of the reviews....735 on friday night and they're locked up. No lights on.

I love La's Thai on McDowell and Hayden much better", "This is actually my third time eating at this buffet & wasn't satisfied with the variety of food choices also it wasn't tasty like before maybe new chefs if they want competition with other casinos they need to improve a lot not only wasn't the food good my boyfriend & I were gonna have dessert but there were a few flies on it bad environment that's why there rating is 2 1/2 that explains it the only good thing about Stratosphere is nice rooms", "The sushi is ok, the bento box is good, but the service is suuuuuuper slowwwww. I would suggest skipping unless you have a serious hankering for 30 mins for your simplest meal", "The food was good but there was this man sitting at the bar with a laptop who I assume was the manager or owner and he kept yelling at all the staff. It made us feel VERY uncomfortable. He kept going behind the bar and grabbing the drink shaker out of the bartenders hand and yelling at her In front of customers for making drinks wrong. I get it if you are the owner and you want the staff to do things a certain way you don't yell at them in front of customers. I could tell our waiter was so embarrassed every time he came to our table.

I ordered two regular burritos which turned out to be filled with air, not meat and other good stuff.  They were meagerly constructed and filled leaving me to really not want to go back there again.

I guess what I'm saying is its far from a chill work environment, so get in, grab your coffee and go!", "This place has an AWESOME fashion exhibit on haute couture. I think that most of the exhibits were great but the security was really creepy and borderline stalking. A security person appeared from nowhere when we parked and tailed us on our walk into the museum. Then once we paid the OVERPRICED $10 admission there was basically someone with an earpiece and a jacket following my friend and me around. I don't know if this place doesn't get a lot of visitors or what, but the Louvre was less guarded than this place. Overall, a totally creepy experience.", "This place looks very dirty.

Every once in the while the burger comes out undercooked, or the bread hard, so that's why I'm not giving it five stars.

We arrived at 6:00PM (despite the holiday, I had to work all day). Prior to being seated I inquired about the Veteran's Day specials and I was bluntly told, by a person in authority, that the restaurant was 'NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF GIVING FREE MEALS AWAY.' ... and that their Veteran's Day specials had ended at 4:00PM... I was also told that the restaurant had gone out of their way to open early for the holiday, which implied that as an Armed Forces Veteran, I was an imposition... the supervisor offered me a 10% discount as a baseless, contrary aside... I never got any discount, by the way.\\n\\nI was quite frank in expressing my position that I did not expect a 'free meal',' nor did I appreciate the condescending tone of the remark . To be clear: I did not ask for a free meal; I inquired about the specials that they had promoted to honor my military service, and I was promptly rebuked. \\n\\nTo the serving staff's credit, they recognized my daughter's birthday in a thoughtful and appropriate fashion. The food was good, and consistent with countless previous visits.\\n\\nI am a longtime fan of the chain, but in light of this experience, I am inclined to more carefully consider my dining-out choices. \\n\\nBased on the representation of the supervisor I spoke with, I am firmly of the opinion that the 'Veteran's Day'  promotion they offered was a shallow, indifferent, and insincere ploy to get business on the holiday, and not an earnest offering in appreciation of my, or any other Veteran's, sacrifices on this occasion.\\n\\nI am a Veteran. I don't need a free meal, or a discount: a simple 'Thanks' will do.", "Don't even know where to start with this place. The interiors are cheap, the blinds, fixtures, carpet and cabinets are garbage for the price you pay. The walls are extremely thin and the zombies that roam the parking lot are frightening to say the least. I don't know if it's because of the bar next door or the projects behind the complex. Nonetheless, they will nickel and dime you upon moving out, they charge exorbitant and outrageous fees.

It's truly a shame because I was so so so looking forward to this experience.\\n\\nThe Wait-  OK, so there is a wait to get inside. This is understandable so I paid the extra $15 to get in with only about 15 min. wait instead of over an hour. This however, is just the FIRST of many waits to be dealt with. \\n\\nBasically, they have the buffet set up very strategically so that each station has the best stuff at the end of the line,(meats, crab, duck, etc...) so hopefully(to them) you use up the real estate on your plate with cheaper more filling stuff first like bread and pastas. I had to wait anywhere from 20-30 min EACH TIME I wanted a new plate of food!!! I couldn't believe it. Anything that you get towards the beginning of the line is ice cold by the time you actually get to eat it.  There is something seriously wrong when it takes you three or four times as long to GET the food as it does to EAT the food.\\n\\nJust to drive home how long it took to get a plate of food (and how bad the service was) they actually RESEATED MY TABLE when I was in line! Are you kidding me? That shows how pathetically long it takes just to get some food here. Basically you have two hours to eat, but good luck getting more than 3 or 4 plates in that time, its just not gonna happen.\\n\\n\\nService-  Basically non-existant. I had to flag someone down every time I needed something, and had to ask 3 times just for some salt and pepper. When they finally brought the S&P, of course I was done with the plate that I wanted it for and then when I came back with another plate is when they reseated the table, so I never actually got to use any on my food. Then they left me standing in the middle of the dinning room like an idiot with my plate of food while they figured out what to do. It was pretty embarrassing actually and obviously the food continued to get colder and colder as I waited for them to simply find me a place to eat. Finally they sat me at a four top in the middle of the dinning room and I was able to eat my piece of thin, cold, over-cooked prime rib.\\n\\nSo, the waits were numerous and unreasonably long, and the service was equal to about a Denny's. But how was the food?...... There was none of the stuff that I was looking forward to. No stone crab claws, no half-lobster, no caviar, no ribeye steak. There was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that stood out from either a quality, taste or creativity standpoint. The snow crab was very watery, as was the shrimp. The lamb chops and prime rib were over-done and cold by the time i got to eat them, and they said they don't put the rib eye out until 6:30... really? But you charge full price the entire time. \\n\\nI was so let down that I just left, and before writing this review, just to give them a fair shot at redemption I called to try to speak with someone at the buffet. The first call went to a machine that did not take messages, the second call just kept ringing and ringing, finally the third time I got someone in \\\"\"total care\\\"\" or something, who when I told her about my experience asked me if I talked to the manager when I was there. Look, I grew up in this business including high-end, low-end and buffets: If you reseat my damn table when I am at the buffet line, YOU have the manager come over and apologize. Don't make me work harder after you screw up. Besides, I never saw a manager when I was there, only  \\\"\"servers\\\"\" and a few ladies that walked around with their ipads trying to jockey the table/seating situation. I certainly didn't see anyone concerned with people's experience.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that the price is reasonable for the buffet, but with so many other places to eat in vegas, there was not a single thing that would ever make me want to go back and wait... to wait... and wait...  to eat bland, run-of-the-mill buffet food.", "Butter Fat Shakes and if you are over 350lbs you eat for free!

Guac was plain, meat in tacos was rubbery and chips were stale...

Wasted a lot of time waiting for help when help arrived I asked for the specific model salesperson asked if I saw the model in the case.  I couldn't tell from across the counter and he told me he had 150000 watches.  Not very helpful and not interested in selling a 500 watch. Bottom line don't bother with Tourneau.  On the other hand Panerai and Breitling boutiques in the same mall were friendly and willing to show and discuss any model. Btw I was wearing Rolex and have a Panerai.  Don't bother with Tourneau.  I would give no stars if possible", "Ok Blue Moon, as much as I appreciate your food, I have to give you some tough feedback that hopefully will gone into making your restaurant all that it could and should be. So as already stated, the food is very good. i love Pho and have tried many different varieties around the valley and I think theirs is one of the better ones. They also have some vegetarian friendly options which is great. The ambiance is nice and I like supporting small businesses. Ok. So here's where the rubber hits the road. The restaurant prides itself on making fresh smoothies to order and there seem to be many tasty choices on the menu (I haven't myself had one). However they BLAST THE BLENDER right there in the dining room! It's so awkward and uncomfortable and all conversation is obliterated by the sound. You'd think they'd notice everyone in the restaurant cringe each time they hit the button, but for some reason nothing changes. So my first piece of advice: MOVE THE BLENDER INTO THE BACK ROOM. Its so obnoxious and in it of itself made me not want to come back. The second issue I had was after ordering veggie spring rolls with my vegetarian  girlfriend, we were served spring rolls with PORK in them. My GF was so upset because she actually swallowed a bit. Not only is she vegetarian but she's also Jewish. NOT COOL PEOPLE. I know that Vietnamese eat pork very regularly but most Jews don't and especially vegetarian ones. Now the right thing to do in this circumstance would be to bring a fresh set of vegetarian rolls and comp them for the inconvenience. At least that's what i would have done if it were my restaurant. Not only did this NOT happen, but there was barely an apology. At the checkout counter when we came up to pay the bill, the waitress was trying to talk me into getting a frequent buyer card, completely oblivious to the fact that we'd had a terrible time at their establishment and would NOT be coming back. Seriously, you have good food; please back it up with some basic customer service and humility.", "Nothing like the original, which I love.  I ordered the poblano chicken burrito.  I got a soggy burrito loaded with dry chicken, go figure. Anyway it's sounded great spicy chicken with grilled pablano, onions,  etc... I asked the waitress she went to the kitchen, only to come back and say it doesn't come with peppers or onions.  My response,  menu says it does. Well we're out of peppers, I can give you 10% off is that ok. No,  I didn't order a pile of chicken I'm a soggy burrito.  5 minutes late she comes back with a side of grilled onion,  peppers,  whatever else was supposed to be in the burrito.  It helps but I'm annoyed and the meat is cold at this point.  Whatever,  I have a flight to catch,  I just paid my tab (no discount), I'm done and never coming back.", "Terrible service. Wrong order brought to table. \\\"\"Restaurant Inspections\\\"\" just gave it 8 defects upon their inspection. Ordered Angus burger tasted like cheap hamburger with gristle.

We ordered Seafood Soup, which literally tasted like chunks of imitation crab and assorted vegetables in water rather than broth. I don't even remember what I had as the entree, it was that forgettable. This place is set up for take out and they have a wide assortment of sauce packets that you pick right out of the boxes they were shipped in. I guess you're supposed to add your own flavor by grabbing handfuls of those. I suggest you use both fists. I will never go back.", "I'm writing this review with a heavy heart. I'm from around the Bisbee area and have eaten at the original Bisbee Breakfast Club. Their service is NOTHING like the service at this one...theirs is fast and efficient. \\n\\nThe first time I came here, things were good. We were seated quickly because there were no people. Food was really good, but took forever to come. I thought nothing of it and thought that the next time would be better. How wrong I was. The second time let me see how badly this place was run. The restaurant has potential but it's being run to the ground by the manager. At least I think she's the manager. She was the women seating people the two times that I've been there. Has somewhat of a hippy look. She needs to be trained IMMEDIATELY. She's beyond unprofessional and her staff is following suit. The bus boy cleaning tables hated his job. He was so slow doing his job and would throw things around. The waitresses were more interested in conversation with each other than servicing their customers.  We were sitting for a good 10-15 min before someone took our drink order. The \\\"\"manager\\\"\" told a waitress to get our drinks. The waitress came over to our table hating life and asked \\\"\"what do you want to drink?\\\"\" There was no smile, how are you, I'm sorry for the wait, nothing. I wouldn't believe what I was seeing. \\n\\nThe food is pretty good, it's a shame that the service is driving people away.

I do not think I will return to this place after last night's experience.  I brought a family member to try this place out and she barely ate the crawfish because she felt like they were frozen and tasted horrible.  \\n\\nI inquired about the crawfish because they were not good.  When I came in April, they were fantastic,  they were delicious, they were Hot and Juicy.  I wanted to know where they came from.   I was told Lousiana.  I asked if those were live when they cooked them... I was told Yes.\\n\\nHere are a few more questions I asked the manager.\\n\\n1.  Do you sell crawfish year round?  ANSWER: Yes.\\n2.  When out of season, do you get them live?    Answer: Yes.\\n3.  Wow, where do you get them from?  ANSWER: From Lousiana.  They have farms that grow them in the off-season.\\n\\nMe...  dumbfounded.  \\n\\nI have lived in the deep south a good portion of my life, eaten crawfish since I was old enough to pinch tails by myself and never... not ever have I had crawfish in the off-season.  Places that sell crawfish in season stop selling them in the off-season... because it's the off season!  HNJ has an interesting distributor that has resources and access to things I've never heard of in my matriculation in LA. \\n\\nWe also ordered a shrimp basket.

I've only been here once, but I know enough to know I'd rather go to Boiling Crab. I decided to get their crawfish since it's in the namesake.

Cousin and cousin's husband had arrived the night before us, walked past Kahunaville, heard the general party atmosphere commotion coming from within, and determined this might be a good spot to spend some time and money. Boy were they wrong.\\n\\nI don't know what was happening the night before, but when we came it was dead. Granted it was early, only about 8:00 or so, but it was a Friday night and we wanted to have fun. The atmosphere is cheesy, reminded me of a Rainforest Caf\\u00e9 but more sleazy, at first I thought it WAS a Rainforest Caf\\u00e9, ha ha ha... \\n\\nWe sat down at the bar and the bartenders outnumbered us. Several of them seemed busy, serving the few customers other than us around the bar. Then our bartender came over, who didn't appear to have any customers as yet, so you would think he'd be happy for the business, but instead gave us an attitude like we were disrupting his relaxation time. My girlfriend asked what he would recommend from the drink menu, which is her MO as she generally doesn't bother with making decisions in unfamiliar territory and relies on what the employees like. Instead of naming off a few drinks or his favorite, or heck, the most expensive thing on the menu because if he'd had the brains to say it she probably would have just bought it, he made some snarky comment about reading the menu. Okay dude, you are on the clock right? Like, this is your job, right? So she ordered a shooter and a margarita, which was overpriced and she said it wasn't that great. Her cousin ordered a flamboyant purple drink that came in a big fishbowl souvenir cup and was smoking with dry ice. It looked really cool and was a big hit but of course was overpriced. Don't know what the husband ordered. For my part I ordered a Monster in the can, which cost $7.00. Outrageous. \\n\\nOn top of that, he mocked my GF's cousin when he asked how we'd like the bill, she clearly stated and gestured that she and her husband would be together. I'm hearing impaired and I could hear her say it, two people down the bar. He copied her gesture and said \\\"\"I don't know what this means,\\\"\" all snippy. All four of us looked at each other like, What's this guy's problem? Did we mistakenly end up at Dicks?  We are literally his only customers! I guess he was either having a bad night or just doesn't like making money. He didn't get any of ours.\\n\\nIt was so awkward after that, we left. I guess the angry bartender had the night off the previous night, because he was clearly not bringing the party on Friday. So we went somewhere else. None of us will be back.", "Meh.  Just so so.

I did, however, decide to book my girlfriend's birthday dinner here because she love's taco's and the ambiance is better than a taco truck. (No offense to Charlie's) Also, the restaurant is located near our final destination for the evening. We showed up 15min early for our reservation but a few people in the party had not arrived. We were told by the hostess that our entire party needed to be there before we could be sat. We decided to order drinks in the bar and sip them near the pool. After we had ordered 3 rounds of drinks the hostess came out to tell us she gave our table away because she couldn't find us. We were all in shock because we had been walking past the hostess stand all night to order drinks. They could not have tried very hard to look for us. We asked to speak to the manager. Instead of being apologetic he came at us with an attitude as if the whole incident were our fault. We told him we couldn't believe the way he was treating us and we would not be back. To that he responded \\\"\"fine you can leave!\\\"\" Two minutes later he came back and offered to cover our bar tab and get us another table. At that point half the party was already outside. It was too little too late. Not sure why the manager (who also claimed to be the restaurant owner) would not come to us apologetic from the start. He has a lot to learn about managing a restaurant and treating customers with respect. They should think about investing in pagers since they have trouble locating guests who have all ready checked in for a reservation!", "I waited 30 min for two Oreo blasts.

I gave it to her, and then got a phone call later that afternoon that they were refunding the first card because the payment went through on both cards.

Not being from the area, I am not sure how well priced the groceries are here, but  most things seemed pretty over-priced (at least compared to similar grocery stores in the Boston area). I was seriously in shock over the price of the M&Ms. Almost $5 for a small bag?! They have their own President's Choice brand, which was more reasonable than name brands and the items that I tried from the President's Choice brand, including the soda and the a variety of baguettes were excellent. The French baguette was particularly good. They also had a good selection of cheese here including many cheeses from Quebec. A goat cheese with figs that I picked up here was particularly good. I do agree with what other yelpers have noted about the customer service. I found that whenever I went here, whether early in the am or later in the evening, there was only one or two cash registers open. The lines were long. One time I ended up walking out of the store without buying the items I intended to because the cashier was just taking so long to resolve some issue with a customer over the phone. I don't understand why she didn't transfer the call to someone at the customer service desk (or do they even have one?) and continue to check out customers that were waiting there in the store.

(I had Lance crackers and a Diet Coke for lunch, so I know whatever I had for dinner is what made me sick).  I cooked the meat to medium and baked the potatoes as directed and I don't think there is anything in biscuits that would cause the issues.  The food didn't taste \\\"\"off\\\"\" at all, so I am not sure what made me so ill, but I won't test the theory as to what it was again.  Except for being exhausted with sore back muscles, I feel fine now, so it isn't the flu.  Leftovers in the trash, Meat House off of my list.  Judging by the other reviews, this has not been a common occurrence, but you don't get to fool me twice.\\n\\n*********\\n\\nI have been wanting to try The Meat House for a while and finally caved tonight deciding I needed some beef.\\n\\nThe store, located in The Village at Robinson Farm off of Rea Rd (in the same shopping center as Cosmos Cafe, Hawthorne's Pizza, Toast and some other offices and small shops), has a nice selection of quality goods: beef, chicken (pre-packaged of both if you are on the run), seafood, cheeses, wines, chips, dips, chains, whips... no wait.... no chains or whips (that I saw...), preserves, a wide variety of well priced spices. I enjoyed my stroll though the small shop.  I decided on the steak tips that are $10.99/lb. in the Meat House marinade and some twice baked potatoes for $7.99/lb., along with a dozen small sweet potato biscuits and a dozen garlic cheese biscuits that are take-and-bake ($4.99/doz.).  On the way out, I saw pimento cheese in the pre-packaged section and decided on that too.  The grand total was $45, which kind of made me wince, but I wanted to try it, so try it I did.  \\n\\nI asked one of the gentlemen behind the counter (after waiting a few minutes - they seemed to be re-stocking or developing a game plan for preparing some foods) how to cook the tips, as I don't have a grill, just a temperamental apartment oven, and he said  broil, or bake at 350 for a bit... I went with broil like I do flank steak and they turned out deeeee-licious.  The pieces of the garlic from the marinade were a little too big for me, so I just scraped them to the side.  I heated the potatoes in my toaster oven and those were creamy and delicious - they had bacon, bacon is good, and I don't even particularly care for potatoes.  The biscuits were tender and browned nicely in just a few minutes.  I haven't tried the pimento cheese yet, but how bad can it be - it's cheese and mayonnaise.\\n\\nLike Whole Foods, I don't know how often I can visit The Meat House, as the prices are a bit steep for my budget, but for a special occasion I would definitely hit them up for some steak tips and twice baked potatoes.", "Worst show I've ever seen.

Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area.

The manager gave us a table and left. After waiting for 15 minutes I decided to walk up to the bar area to check if we will be served at all.

I went in for an oil change because the place is close to my home.  I was told the oil drain plug was stripped. (The plug is screwed in, so if the plug thread is stripped, the plug cannot stay in the drain.) I need to replace the oil pan, which is about $400. I didn't do it that day because I didn't have the time.  The car started leaking oil on my garage floor that night.  (There was no oil leaking before that day.)  I didn't want to go back to Big O and instead took my car to my usual mechanic, who is farther away from my home.  My mechanic told me that it was not that easy to strip the oil plug, though there is no proof Big O stripped it.  \\n\\nHere was what really upset me: When I did the oil change at Big O, they checked other things and gave me recommendations on repairs. They said one of the axle was broken and the grease from that axle had been spun off and could be seen everywhere around the axle.  I told that to my mechanic, and he asked me into his shop and look from under the car.  There was no grease!  The axle was fine!  I had a couple of oil changes at this Big O before and was quite pleased.  But never again will I go there.  Nor should you.", "By far the worst beef shawarma I've ever had!

Live less than a mile away started writing after finishing 3 luke warm bland tacos.  Probably not going back. Until they upgrade their staff.  \\n\\nOne more thing... Get rid of the singing.. It's demeaning to your staff. I'm sure they don't make a ton of money and to have them drone out some half hearted song about cheese or a new customer is revolting.  And really...after waiting for the length of time it would take to wrap up a meal at a fine dining restaurant.... Do you think my moods going to improve with the staff taking time out to sing?? It only perpetuates the situation.

I would not wish them on anyone. Renters beware.", "We were doing some shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter and around Kierland and had decided to eat lunch here. I had read past reviews and had always wanted to try it. It was also really cute decor. I have been to France several times and felt they really nailed the \\\"\"bistro\\\"\" look so I was excited. However as soon as we walked in, the hostess immediately stopped us and explained that they have a dress code: men in tank tops are not allowed. As she's saying this, I see a family with small children wearing regular, casual clothing and another young woman dressed about as casual as you can get.  Let me preface that this was late June with temperatures over 100 on a Saturday at lunch. I can understand a dress code for dinner but lunch? Here in Phoenix? Really?? I've been to weddings where people wore flip flops. I've lived all over and phoenix is by far a very casual place because its so hot. I was pretty surprised. Granted, the hostess wasn't rude about it but I guess I didn't see the place as being that high end. Needless to say, we left and went to North instead. Their staff was incredibly friendly. What a difference. I guess Zinc is taking the French thing literally.", "I was very unimpressed. \\n\\nWe started ordering our food and some college kid actually pushed in front of us while we were placing an order and started ordering his own food.

After requesting the forgotten food the woman brought it out and slammed it down on our table. It was all a very strange and confusing experience, as we were being polite and friendly despite the terrible service. \\n\\nTo top off terrible service the steak lunch special came out as strips of fat.

The second time though, is the reason this review only gets two stars.  I went in for gel nails and a pedicure.  The gel nails looked fabulous afterwards, which is part of the reason they are getting two stars.  The pedicure was the problem.  My feet are very sensitive and almost always needs to have the callus treatment done during a pedicure.  They used what I call a cheese grater, which I'm sure has a different name at the nail salon.  As they continued to \\\"\"grate\\\"\" one of my calluses, I noticed my foot was beginning to get really sensitive and turning bright red.  She was very rough as she was trying to remove the callus, which is next to impossible...I'll always have calluses.  The nails looked great but after a couple of days I noticed the area was still super sensitive and I was starting to get a blister over the callus.  Long story short, the blister turned into two small blisters, and then back into a big blister, that ended up getting infected.  Since my regular doctor was closed, I had to go to urgent care to have them tell me that it was indeed infected...obviously I already knew that.  They also gave me some antibiotic pills to help the infection.  I feel as though just smoothing it would have been better than what she was trying to do.

I've been doing sumits, bikram and hot yoga for six years in Arizona and this by far has been my WORST experience! I recently moved and was looking for a new studio so signed up for their two week trial. Come to my second class and ask for a yoga/mat rental and they lady says sorry we don't have any more but I could buy one for more than 60 dollars!!!!! Any other studio would have opened one of their mats and added it to their rental collection or would have not even made the mistake in the first place of not providing sufficient rental equipment. At the very least she could have extended my trial membership by one day since I didn't get to attend class today. It was extremely annoying. When you're paying ridiculous amounts for classes they should accommodate you better. If this yoga studio is just in a convenient location for you and you have money to blow then it's ok, but if you're lookig for true value and great teachers and atmosphere then check out some of the other studios in the area. Lucky for you Scottsdale has a ton and this yoga studio doesn't offer anything you cant get somewhere else.\\n\\nAlso, most of their good reviews are from when they were a part of Sumits Yoga. I've been to a couple sumit yoga studios and loved it every time. They've parted ways with sumit as they don't carry the studio name anymore (made clear by the outline of letters torn off their store front) so don't be deceived by these reviews that stem from when they had a previous owner as this is not the same place anymore and clearly the new management is struggling to follow in sumit's footsteps.", "I'll make this quick and to the point.\\n\\nThe service here is awful.

My husband ordered the sausage and peppers sandwich and it had absolutely nothing going for it; there wasn't even cheese (bizarre).  Just the appearance of it would be enough to send anyone who likes sausage and peppers sandwiches into a deep depression. He ended up just forgetting about it and we picked him up a different meal on the way home. We ordered the chicken strips and fries for our toddler and they gave us half the number of strips that is listed in the description and simply explained that they ran out of them yet still charged us for the full order (weird). It was frankly as if the staff was aware that the place was mediocre and had utterly given up even the pretense of customer service.  When we arrived, we were the only patrons there yet when our food was ready, it wasn't brought to our table. Someone barked and so my husband went and picked it up. It was just an oddly missed opportunity to do the obvious thing and bring the food the 20 feet between kitchen and table. I had pizza and it was fine but unremarkable.
